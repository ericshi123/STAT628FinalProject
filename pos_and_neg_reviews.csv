0,Popeyes,1.0,Awful.  Waited in line for 15-20 for a chicken sandwich and a biscuit.  I didn't get what I ordered and the chicken sandwich had a bone in it.  The staff was 50/50 miserable compared to helpful. Unacceptable.,-0.8,Negative
1,Popeyes,1.0,"This is my first time at the Hartsfield Airport and I had no idea what the service at the Hartsfield Airport Popeyes would be like.  Sadly, it was far worse than any other Popeyes restaurant I've ever dealt with.

There were four employees there, working shoulder to shoulder, but despite their close proximity to each other, couldn't seem to communicate with each other.  The first employee took my order (Two large red beans & rice, one large Cajun fries and one grilled chicken sandwich), and wrote my name (Steve) on two paper bags.

Perhaps a minute or two later another employee starts calling out, ""STEVE!  IS THERE A STEVE HERE? STEVE?  STEVE?""

I was standing just a few inches away from her and said, ""I'm Steve.""

""YOU HAVE TWO RED BEANS AND RICE AND A LARGE CAJUN FRY?"" she asked me, yelling like a drill sergeant.

""Yes,"" I confirmed, ""Two large red beans and rice and a large Cajun fries"".

""ALSO A GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH?""

""Yes,"" I confirmed, ""One chicken sandwich.""

I ended up confirming my order with her and one other employee about three or four times.  Both with her and another employee who also shouted like a drill sergeant.

I thought this was ridiculous.  In most fast-food restaurants I only have to give my order information to one employee and I only have to do it once.  And traditionally none of the employees yell like drill sergeants.

The cashier also asked what was on my order, so I confirmed with her as well that I was supposed to get two large red beans and rice, one large Cajun fries and one grilled chicken sandwich.

My bill came to eighteen dollars and some change.  I paid the cashier and took my food to my boarding gate, approximately 300 yards away from the Popeyes restaurant and when I opened my bags I discovered that (despite the fact that I had told FOUR employees everything that was on my order), that my grilled chicken sandwich (which I had paid $5.17 for) was not in either bag.

I realize that fast food employees aren't paid very much, but when I give my order information to FOUR employees at a restaurant I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that they should give me all the food that I paid for.",-0.06190476190476191,Negative
2,Popeyes,4.0,"They weren't ready for the return of the chicken. They stopped taking orders when the restaurant appeared half full. The drive thru only had appeared to have about ten cars. They took on Chick-Fil-A on a day that they are closed. Definitely not the expedient service that I get at Chick-Fil-A, but to be fair, I get no service on Sunday at Chick-Fil-A!

As I write this review I see that cars are starting to wrap around the store. I don't know how it will go as the day goes on. But it's high noon and there's a showdown brewing. 

Chick-Fil-A has an awesome chicken sandwich. Always crispy and tasty. The sauces are also a huge plus at Chick-Fil-A. 

So I was in the drive thru while my wife was in line. She was able to order, so I hopped out of line. All of the cars in the drive thru behind me were gone before we got our food. It seems like it may be best to go in the drive thru. Even though the drive thru line is now running out of the lot. I'm guessing that they put a huge priority on the drive thru orders. 

People inside appear to be very angry. Two separate people complained about waiting nearly an hour for a sandwich. They said it on the way out somewhat grumbling. Perhaps attempting to warn others before they order. Unfortunately, my order is already in! And new people, with eyes full of hope are standing in line. Most of the people that were here with my half hour ago and still here. 

Now people are verbally warning others loudly about a 40 minute and counting wait. A gentlemen just walked out. Another cashier is calling number 13 about twelve times. Number 13 may have died of starvation. I'm scanning to ensure that no one appears to be hypoglycemic. 

My order is here! We are sitting at a very dirty table, I don't care, all I want is chicken. We ordered one regular and one spicy. 

The bread and chicken size get the nod. The texture of the breading is fantastic. The spicy flavor at Chick-Fil-A wrecks Popeye's. But the chicken sandwich here is great. 

The service was friendly despite a trying circumstance for the employees. Even so, the service and speed are far better at Chick-Fil-A. Well not counting the closest competition Chick-Fil-A, I don't even believe they are a real Chick-Fil-A.

11,Popeyes,1.0,"Pity the fool.

Woe to anyone who spends a dime at this Popeye's.  The many recent 1* reviews we found on Yelp are 100% true.  This location has the most incompetent and dishonest employees we've ever encountered in any restaurant in our life.  No exaggeration. 

No excuses on this visit:  we went at 5pm, before the dinner rush; we were the only car in the drive-through; and we saw at least 6 people wearing Popeye's uniforms standing around 'working' inside.

Our order was wrong:
1. Ordered spicy.  Repeated it twice to the young girl on the speaker taking our order, who repeated our order back to us correctly.  We received mild.  Mild was printed on our receipt. 
2. Our order was for 10 pieces of spicy mixed chicken.  Our box had 5 small drumsticks; 4 minuscule wings; and a teeny-tiny thigh. Our receipt showed we received 3 drumsticks; 3 wings; 2 thighs; and 2 breasts. Nope. Not even close.
3.  Paid for an additional spicy chicken sandwich.  We don't know if it was spicy, because our chicken sandwich was not included in our to-go bag.  Even though we paid for it and it was printed on our receipt. We can only conclude our chicken sandwich was stolen out of our order by an employee.
4. The tiny chicken pieces in our order were grossly over-cooked to the point of being inedible. Dry and shrunken and stringy and tasted burned.  We threw everything except the cole slaw and biscuits out.
5. The red beans and rice side we ordered was 75% dry over-cooked rice.  There were hardly enough red beans to cover the bottom of the small container.
6. The printed menu showed our 'family meal' order included 6 biscuits.  And '6 biscuits' was printed on our receipt.  The small box in our bag only had 5 biscuits.

We made the mistake of paying without looking at our receipt.  And compounded that mistake by then driving home without looking in our bag of food. 

The sheer incompetence, or stupidity, or most likely all of this plus the intentional manipulation and theft related to our order at this location boggles the mind.  

How many other customers aren't given the food they paid for?  Incompetent customer service notwithstanding, if you pay for something, isn't the store obligated to give you what you bought? 

In hindsight, we noticed the employees are mostly all grossly overweight.  Is this due to them stealing and then eating the customer's stolen food?  

Stealing food out of customer's orders means these dishonest employees would not get caught stealing from their employer.  So they keep their job while they fill up eating free stolen food.  

We suspect most customers will simply write-off the missing food as a random mistake.  Many customers won't even realize their order is wrong until they are long gone from the restaurant 20+ minutes down the interstate.  

Doing the math, if these dishonest employees steal  food from every customer like they stole ours, the amount of employee theft at this location is staggering.

Never eat here.  Don't go, no matter how much you crave a Popeye's spicy chicken sandwich.  Although we can't give a review of their spicy chicken sandwich, because the one we bought was stolen by the employees.",-0.13273809523809518,Negative

14,Popeyes,1.0,"Yeah.... if I could give this place zero stars I would. Me and some friends went to Popeyes the other day and I was just outright appalled with my experience. Here were my problems.
First problem- the store opens at 10. Or it's supposed to anyway. The employees didn't open the doors until about 20 minutes later and one of them was on the phone walking around looking at us look at her. Yes, I know that's early to be eating chicken... (it's honestly never too early to eat chicken now that I think about it) but after working a graveyard shift and running errands, some chicken sounded great to all of us. Specifically that sandwich.
Second problem- when we wanted to order those chicken sandwiches, one of the employees told us that that it would take a while for the chicken to get ready. We were kind of frustrated and told him to give us a second so he walked away. As he walked away, the employees in the kitchen were still prepping and preparing. The ladies in the kitchen then got mad at us and started speaking Spanish about us. Little did they know, one of our friends is bilingual and heard them say, ""how do you expect us to have everything ready when we just opened five minutes ago?"" And my response to my friend was that the store was supposed to be opened 30 minutes ago. 
We eventually got our chicken sandwiches but when we wanted sauces they said it was one sauce per combo!!! What the heck???? 
I thought fast food restaurants were supposed to be ready and prepped when the store opened?

I guess it's that good, but now we were left with the choice to still order something else or come back another time. We decided to order a chicken meal and call it a day. Well, the whole experience was rather disappointing and after placing our order we realized that maybe we made the wrong decision. Customer after customer that were already there before us, all had something to complain about. Either they had something missing or they were waiting for so long because they totally forgot about their order. Certain items on the menu besides the chicken sandwiches were out. They were out of Cajun fries, pickles, certain sauces, and even some of the sodas. The young workers looked burnt out and it showed so bad on their faces and body language, almost zombie like. I felt so sorry for them as the lines were forming and they just could not keep up. We waited for at least 30 min for our food and when we got home, we realized they forgot our apple pies.

25,Popeyes,2.0,"Let's start with the good news.  There is a place for people who just couldn't hack working at McDonald's.

Last week I went through the drive through to try this chicken sandwich.  Bun was smooched and the chicken tender leaning toward soggy.  Not really that impressive.  That just primed me to get some good chicken on a Saturday night.  14-piece meal with half and half, 7 biscuits, mashed potatoes/gravy with cole slaw.  I really like the flaky breading on the chicken and the pepper tones to the gravy.  Biscuits are the same old dense pucks.

By going in, I saw why the chicken sandwiches sucked, why the biscuits are always cold, and why the drive through is so slow.  About 40-50 sandwiches were pre-made and sitting in two piles under the warmer.  How does FIFO work with that process?  And in the 25 unbelievable minutes it took me to order and get my food, only about 5 were sold.  Gross.

So let's run through this, shall we?
-Enter the store, and no one is in the seating area.  Temperature was about 65, and I was chilly wearing a coat.
-I was third person in line.  No one seemed to be tending the counter.  No cohesive expediter function.  After about 5 minutes, the woman and her child waiting at the register left.  Now second in line!
-They didn't have record of my online order, and only 5 orders were on the screen.  So I reordered about 10-12 minutes after entering the store.
-They couldn't provide a receipt as proof of purchase.  Out of paper.
-Out of fries too.
-Couldn't really figure out where my order was in process.  Several boxes were being filled with various order components, getting cold by sitting on the counter waiting on other parts.

With the explosive marketing of their new chicken sandwich I would have liked to see Popeye's use the opportunity to build a stronger customer base. Instead the restaurant in my area appeared to use the opportunity to cement the fact that the customer experience does not rank high on the priorities list. Closing down the drive thru without signage, staffing one cashier, one person putting together orders and two cooks during one of the biggest and incredibly brilliant marketing breakthroughs in a long time ....appears intentional. 

I tried both the classic and the spicy sandwich and preferred the spicy. The classic was bland and dry while the spicy has a bold tasting sauce and more flavor. For me the sandwich is made in a Paul Deen type style....Extra fat, calories and a big portion of crispy batter. The batter makes the sandwich appear huge and creates a feeling of value. It tastes good fresh out of the fryer with the understanding that it is a guilty pleasure food experience that should not be repeated often.

Once in your hands, it is worth the wait.  The chicken filet is crunchy on the outside and moist and tender in the center.  It is seasoned with mayo and dill pickles.  The bun stands up to the breast filet and seasoning to make quite a neat and tasty package.  I very much enjoyed my sandwich.

If I'm nearby Popeye's Louisiana Chicken in the future, I would stop and have a sandwich.  I found it to be clean and well kept.  The employees were polite but a little overworked, which given the circumstances is understood.  Youth is a marvelous thing.  I didn't use the restroom.

My favorite item is the biscuit!! So soft and melts in your mouth. I have to practice self control in order to not eat them all. It tastes even better with butter, but I forgot to ask for some. For the chicken, I ordered half regular and half spicy and honestly couldn't tell which was which but it was still good though. The mashed potato is pretty good too although KFC is better. Don't even bother getting the mac and cheese, so bland we didn't even finish it. I haven't had the cajun fries in awhile, but I remember liking that.

Most of the drinks in the soda machine were undrinkable, they ran out of tea (and did not replace it after being told) and there was a lack of cleanliness. In the back, the operation did not look clean at all either. If they had to complete an inspection, they definelty would've failed. When I recieved my food it was also slightly cold. 

I understand that the chicken sandwich meals have been a huge curve ball for many of these establishments, but I still expect a level of cleanliness and good service when I'm paying for it. 

Overall, I've had both the spicy and original chicken sandwhichs, and they're both just ok. The only difference between the two is that one has some type of spicy sauce that comes on the sandwich, while the original has no kind of extra sauce on it. 

On the plus side, the prices of the meals are pretty reasonable, and they will fill you up. I advise you to go on a day and a time when the demand will be low (ex. during a weekday, during peak work hours). Service might be faster, and there might be less errors.",0.09523809523809526,Positive

The spicy mayonnaise was just the right amount of spice, not too much and not too little. The pickles complemented the sandwich well with it's crunchy texture and juicy flavor.

There was no sign or communication regarding the wait time and once we were in the drive through ... we were stuck. No apology was even given at the order window. This lack of respect for your patron's time ... doesn't go unnoticed.  I saw lots of disappointed customers faces .

The fries and green beans were also delicious. And the bourbon fudge pie was amazing, and pricey for the size.

89,Popeyes,3.0,"Stopped in here to grab one of these famous chicken sandwiches everyone's been raving about.  Disappointed to find out I came the day after they sold out and discontinued them.  Really sad about that.  

Ended up ordering a value meal, which included some chicken tenders, 2 sides, and 2 desserts for like 10 bucks.  Pretty good value.  The chicken tenders weren't amazing but they weren't bad either.  Popeyes was my go-to for drink food back in college.  I remember the chicken being way better, but I guess that was just the alcohol.  

The sides weren't bad.  The Mac n Cheese was actually pretty good.  The Cajun fries were tasty too.  Think my favorite was the biscuit that came with it though.  Rivaled the biscuits at Red Lobster in my opinion.  The apple pies I got were good as well. 

Overall, definitely bummed about the lack of chicken sandwiches, but I still got a decent meal for a good value.  Can't be disappointed with that.",-0.05378787878787876,Negative

Chicken Sandwich? Well, the piece of chicken I got was only half breaded and there was only like two drops of spicy mayo.

As soon as I pulled up there was a sign on the light post outside of the Popeye's parking lot stating that wait times could be 50-90 minutes. That was insane. However, my wait time only lasted 20 minutes. 

The guy taking the order at the drive through was courteous and informative. As soon as we pulled up he advised that there was a 4 sandwich limit per car. There was only 2 of us so that wasn't a problem. And I was surprised that despite how busy they were that they allowed modifications to the very popular sandwich. (We needed one without mayo)

The sandwich was thick, juicy and the breading was crunchy but not overly so. I loved the spicy sauce on it and the pickles were fresh, thick and crisp. Everything came together nicely. It was good, but not out of this world. I'll be back once the hype over and it dies down.",0.05588235294117645,Positive
95,Popeyes,3.0,"Over 26 years I've been raised on good manners and chick fil a, so when this outsider, Popeyes, came to the table with their ""chicken sandwich"" I was intrigued; not because I've ever doubted the CFA perfected sandwich and lemonade combo but rather I was looking for more reinforcement. 

My thoughts:
My pallet was prepped with a nice water, in order for the palate to have no other taste upon the palate. 

The sandwich had nice volume. Chicken was not lacking at all and covered the important bun-to-chicken surface area ratio. The flavor profile was just alright though. 

Today's meal felt a lot like a recent ice cream trip I had where I was in need of some great ice cream and was instead given some sort non dairy, non-gmo bs-like chalky substance that vegans think count as ice cream.

So we just ordered a 9 piece chicken meal with mashed potatoes and Cajun rice. The mashed potatoes with gravy are delicious but we had an issue with the chicken.

It makes sense that the chicken would be fried prior to speed up the process but to pre-assemble the sandwiches is gross. Even if I wanted a sandwich with pickles I certainly wouldn't want it knowing that my sandwich has been sitting there for who knows how long before I even placed my order. 

It would take seconds if the chicken was pre-fried to grab a bun, add mayo and then add pickles. Sandwich complete. The fact that they won't make a custom sandwich is disappointing.",-0.13191964285714286,Negative

Anyhow, the sandwich was nice and fresh, it really was the sauce that made it spicy. It had nice thick cut pickles in it and the bread was nice and fluffy. I think this sandwich taste similar to the chicken sandwich at Shake shack. I didn't really understand what was so good about it, but at least I got to try it.

As far as the ghost wings go, they were not spicy at all. I even had one and I was wondering where the spice was. It was fresh though and you could tell that it was recently made.

The chicken sandwich was absolutely amazing! It was crispy and crunchy on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside! It's served with lettuce, pickles, and I'm going to assume a special sauce?

The Cajun fries had great flavor as well. 

The customer service was awesome considering how busy they were! They were super friendly and kind!

137,Popeyes,2.0,"Ugggggggh! It PAINS me to give this experience 2 stars. However, it's what I can be at peace with giving.
Our experience initially started off with all 5 stars. We arrived here at 10:30 this morning. We were the second car in line in the drive-thru. The place opened at 11:00- but we had just found out this morning prior to arrival, the chicken sandwiches were back! Since we had missed our chance the first go round for these ""famous"" delights, we knew we had to go today on National Sandwich Day! 
So my husband and I were the 2nd car, our daughter and her boyfriend the 3rd car. By 11:00 opening time, the line was literally wrapped around the building and spilling onto the Main Street that leads to this location's parking lot. During our wait (completely elective, mind you), a woman (presumably the manager) was going car to car informing everyone that they don't open until 11:00. Not sure why she felt the need to tell us that, but ok. So we get to the speaker to place our order and that's when we went from 5 stars down to 2-
We ordered 6 regular chicken sandwiches. Specifically, 3 without mayo, 1 completely plain and 2 without pickle. Apparently, this was just information overload for the woman on the other side of the speaker. She continued to repeat the order for the sandwiches incorrectly, and when we would attempt to correct her, this caused her to get a major attitude. This was literally the biggest communication breakdown over something so simple. And we were CAR #2 for the start of the day, no less. We weren't ONLY ordering the 6 sandwiches, but apparently this woman (our receipt says ""Veronica"", but who knows if that's who this actually was, as at one point during our ordering, it was noticeably a new voice coming through the speaker)- we eventually ordered a large Cajun rice and 2 large drinks.
Our order totaled almost $32.00.
We get our bag of sandwiches all to realize after pulling away (of course), that even after all of that nonsense, we were only given 5 sandwiches, not 6- and the 5 we got were just thrown in a bag, with their individual bags barely shut (PETTY, clearly).
So, this location owes us our money back for the sandwich they shorted us and we definitely won't be back to this location any time soon after that.

The service is also great, cashiers are friendly even when very busy. Keep in mind they have been busy every time I went so order ahead online if possible.

I will always recommend ordering online because the drive-thru line is insanely long during regular meal times. If you order online you tell them when you will pick it up and just go inside and a cashier will get you your food. 

Keep in mind the sauce isn't free anymore (I'm not sure if it was before but we were always able to ask for sauce at the pickup of our food before). If you want sauce put it in your order or they will force you to pay extra. We haven't figured out how to order sauce with the online meals so we haven't been without the delicious sauce for a few months. That is the only reason I took away stars, I'm not sure why I am not given sauces with my meal especially when ordering a family meal.

So a couple of things:  spicy chicken sandwich was secured here, around 11am on a Saturday.  No lines, no nothing.  They're totally worth the hype btw.

We were promptly greeted at the drive thru box by 2 different friendly voices and I proceeded to order just the sandwich. The gentleman that ended up taking the order was friendly and efficient as he gave me the total and had me pull up. When we pulled up to the window I was given the total and I handed him my payment while he handed me the goods. Join receiving my card and receipt I wished him a nice day and pulled out. Mom proceeded to open the GIANT $4.58 monster of a sandwich. Upon inspection it looked picture perfect with a dab of mayo and a pickle perfectly peeking out from the bun. I took a bite waiting for the magic and got a mouthful of popeyes chicken. It was hot and fresh with good flavor but not sure why people got in first fights over it and waited hours in line.

188,Popeyes,2.0,"The key to good food no matter where it's from is freshness, and sadly, the day I went that happened to be Christmas day left me feeling dissatisfied. 

I had the best chicken sandwich a few days prior from the same chain and was craving it all week long, so when I was driving up the Turnpike and saw this location was open, I was super pumped!

Chicken sandwich I ordered came in spicy, and it was due to their intercom not working well; I corrected the lady but she must not have heard me. 

What made my chicken sandwich undesirable was that it was not as juicy as I've had before; they must have pre-made 10 or more sandwiches and just left them there. This causes the crunchiness of the batter to go soggy, not to mention the bun and chicken loosing its' freshness. 

Sure I know it's fast-food but surely they are capable of doing so much better like not making so many sandwiches in advanced. 

I had to return one of the sandwiches since it was spicy and went inside; that's when I saw how many were just sitting there with no one in line at that moment ready to buy any. Yes it's a matter of efficiency but there's a slippery slope to quality; I would have gladly waited 5 mins for a freshly done sandwich.

190,Popeyes,3.0,"Ordered here two separate times this year (I've only
gone here many years before prior to this). Went there for the chicken sandwiches because other fast food places don't compare (Wendy's, McDonald's and especially Burger King). 
The first time it was 5 original chicken sandwiches that I ordered on the app, but they couldn't find my order when I got there. No big deal. The drive thru was relatively fast and my sandwiches were made fast. When I got home, only four of those were original and one was spicy. Not what I asked for.

The other time my husband went because I wanted a chicken sandwich and Chick-Fil-A wasn't as close (not that they compare). He ordered two original sandwiches. When he brought them home and I bit into one of the sandwiches, it was spicy. Again, not what I asked for. I thought I could eat it but I wasn't in the mood for spicy (which is why I ordered the original), so I ended up switching with my husband half way. Much longer wait this time because he said the drive thru was packed, and it still ended up being wrong. 

Do I just have back luck or do the workers just suck that bad that I've had wrong orders twice already for the same product? Giving three stars because the size of the sandwich is decent and it tastes good (if you get what you ask for).",1.4481169886415085e-17,Neutral

I love the new chicken sandwich but everytime I go in there and order it, I order extra sauce on the side( because we all know the dangers of ordering extra sauce on a bun.) I have now been told that because they dont have a button to ring it up, they cant give me it on the side. So you can only drown my sandwich but even though I'm willing to pay extra for spicy mayo mind you, I cant get what I want as a customer. This has happened now 3X and the other 2, it was a fight. Popeyes your customer satisfaction is going to suffer if you dont reach your employees that doing the right thing over 50 cents worth of mayo. You lost a fairly new customer.

I will say each time I went I had to wait 15-20 minutes In the drive thru because they are incredibly slowww. 

The first time I went I ordered there signature chicken box with two sides of mashed potatoes and coleslaw. The chicken was way to salty and the food was cold! It tasted old, I also had a dr.pepper drink that tasted watered down, I thought maybe it was because I went late at night that was probably the reason... Nope

My second experience was when I ordered the spicy chicken sandwiches one for me and one for my brother with cajun fries and two dr.pepper drinks, I also ordered the strawberry pies and apple pies. The chicken sandwich was wayyy to spicy, it tasted rubbery and it was cold, the Cajun fries were cold, soggy, and stale, and the drinks also tasted water downed it didn't taste like soda. The  pies were  hard as rock,cold and coated in way to much cinnamon and sugar they were not pleasant at all. Way to overpriced when I can get a better meal at chic fil a. 

My third experience was with the chicken tenders box that comes with 2 sides and no drink even tho they advertise it with a drink. I thought whatever since there soda tasted off anyways.. well the chicken tenders were cold and stale, noodles fresh at all, the Mac & cheese I got was cold, soggy and very watery... and the coleslaw I got was way to watery.. This was the last time I went there and will  not be going to Popeyes anymore, the servers there take forever, they seem lost and they would rather be on there phones and chit chatting with there co workers rather then getting the orders together in a quickly timely matter. Also they seem to have so much attitude for working at a fast food place.. like if you dont wanna work there go somewhere else.

Maybe the lightning fast turnover and low volumes (this was my 3rd time trying to get this sandwich and they've run out every time).  The crust is seasoned like on their chicken on the bone and very crunchy, that's the best part.  The pickles are thick and tart, and I'd personally like more.  I do like a lot of spice, so also dressed it up with 2 packs of their hot sauce.  better (in my estimation) than most of the other fast food sandwiches available out there.

The drive thru line was already starting to come out of the parking lot. We parked are vehicle and stood in line outside the store. There were about 12 people in line to go into the store. At 10:02 we all take notice that a gentlemen  who we assumed to be the manager looked extremely irritated. He kept looking at us and shaking his head, and then walking around the store fixing chairs as opposed to opening the door. He finally unlocked the door at 10:05 when the crowd started to get really annoyed. When we all walked in, he did not greet us he left to go behind the store. Their was one cashier, she was still counting change so she could not ring anyone up yet. The first gentleman was finally able to place his order in around 10:12am. The line started to take notice that there wasn't any chicken cooked at all yet. I think we all
Assumed that they would be prepared for the crowd and have some cooked already.  Instead we noticed he put out the regular chicken out first. When literally everyone in line was there for sandwiches. By the  managers actions you could tell he hoped that the lot of us would leave if the food wasn't available. If that was his motive it worked. We decided to leave, and I did ask for his name so i could file a complaint. A few other people asked Me what his name was as well. I gave it to them, when we walked out the line was far worse and already piling into the intersection of the street. Of course problem Naturally asked me why i wasn't walking out with food.

So, I ordered the infamous chicken sandwich to see what all the hype has been about. It was easy enough to order online. I didn't know that door dash was what would be delivering my meal. The website didn't tell me. Didn't matter though. Now for the sandwich. I opted for the spicy version. Btw The spice doesn't come From the breading. It's the Mayo. The packaging was neat and I liked how they wrapped the sandwich so it wasn't messy. It looks super impressive and tasty and it's huge but looks are deceiving . My first bite was extremely underwhelming. The amount of breading on the chicken was ridiculous. Essentially I was eating breading on a brioche bun with spicy mayo and pickles. Speaking of which there wouldn't be a taste without the mayo and pickles. I didn't finish the sandwich. I drank the soda. The fries were cold and not ""cajun"" flavored enough for me. I haven't eaten at Popeyes in forever and this sandwich did not stand out to me. There are much better chicken sandwiches out there for less than their price point.",-0.05791666666666665,Negative

The four stars are mostly for their chicken sandwich, but the restaurant was clean and orderly. Popeyes Chicken was larger, crispier and thicker than what I expected. Their chicken and bread are definitely better, however, their spicy chicken sandwich wasn't spicy at all. They add some sort of spicy mayo on it, but they put so little that you can't really taste it. My boyfriend asked for extra spicy mayo and after adding a huge spoon of it to my sandwich, it was much better. I like that Chick-fil-A's breading is actually spicy, but overall the size and crispiness of Popeye's chicken was a sure winner. Service goes to Chick-fil-A without a doubt though.",-0.05899122807017543,Negative
236,Popeyes,3.0,"My worst experience at a Popeye's restaurant with food quality. The food was horrible, both pieces of chicken, thigh and wing, were the tiniest I've ever seen, lacking much flavor even though it was suppose to be ""spicy"". The mashed potatoes and gravy were cold. The only bright spot here...customer service was outstanding, cashier's were taking orders expeditiously, someone else was packing the order, and another gentleman was filling drinks. There was also an employee making their rounds of the small seating area, wiping tables, asking individuals if they were done and carrying there trash away. They definitely had an emphasis on customer service. I'm sure if I'd complained about the food it would have been replaced but this was a quick stop enroute to my flight home. 

*On a side note, I thought this was opportunity to try the infamous new chicken sandwich but there was a sign a the register that it was NOT sold at that location. At that point I was committed. There are plenty of other places to eat in this terminal, or stick with the chicken tenders...they looked pretty good on the person's plate next to me.",-0.0823953823953824,Negative

I decided to visit this location after 6 years of surviving without the delicious chicken.

However I managed to score a spot as I was pulling in to the lot as someone else was departing. 
The store inside itself was cleaner than expected and actually a pleasant spot to zin out while taking in the whole Louisiana spiced foods being cooked up. 
Very welcoming and friendly counter staff. Really enjoyed it as they took time to speak with each customer encountered. 

I specially went for this all-new Chicken Sandwich that I keep seeing and hearing everyone raving about and boy I gotta tell y'all, BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!! Popeyes reaaaally out did themselves with this filling and tasty sandwich. I now have a different look on chicken sandwich. I of course chose the spicy version versus the original and it was delicious.

(Note to people not familiar with the area: this at least a 3 mile distance).

(It should be noted that only drive thru and counter service are open; no inside seating is allowed at this time.  Masks are required due to local ordinance).

Manager and sandwich line cook were not wearing masks properly over their noses.  He also did not say anything to family that came in to order without wearing any masks, even though signs in window and right next to cashier state masks must be worn.

Manager got into a full on argument with an Uber driver over food and Uber contract regulations - in the middle taking the maskless family's order. Apparently this location will not make up an uber order until the driver is there for the pickup, so the ""food is hot"" when picked up. 

Long drive through line wrapping around building is why I went in to order. Only 2 groups in front of me - shouldn't take long to order, right? WRONG!!
Drive thru line moved slowly (from reports from my group in car outside), but at least it moved - although looking back, not sure that these people ever got their food as there were a lot of cars parked out front waiting.

Manager inside store would only take one order and wait until jt was completely filled before moving on to next order - even if food had to be cooked for that order. So the huge Uber order was now in front of the maskless family's dinner orders.  All we wanted were 2 chicken sandwiches that we've heard so much about. I could see the chicken filets in the sandwich area as the cook just put a fresh bin up . . . But can't even order until all of the big family meals of chicken and shrimp and wings are cooked for the orders ahead of me.

The uber guy gets his many bags of food. The maskless family finally gets their dinners.  The guys in front of me order and get their bags of food.

I think Yay!! I'm next! I can finally order those 2 chicken sandwiches!!  Why wouldn't I think I'm next to order? I'm next in line right?  

WRONG! 

I get to cashier and he asks if I'm with Uber. I say no. He points to guy two back behind me (who walked in 5 minutes earlier) and says he's with Uber and his order needs to be completed first, and to wait.

Coming here was a Big Mistake! Big! HUGE! (to quote a certain movie). We left and went to Chick-fil-A and will never come back.  So much for trying one of those Popeyes Chicken sandwiches . . .",-0.0027403414195867042,Neutral

We ended up waiting for about 30 minutes and nothing. I had to send someone in and see what was going on and they still had to wait about 10-15. The employees started talking about him in the back right in front of him where he was able to hear them. When he got back to the car, all they gave him was the three chicken sandwiches and not the family meal. We then had to send my mom in to get the rest of the order where the employee gave her a nasty attitude saying she ""remembers this order"" and knows ""they got their food already"" when we clearly didn't. The lady then proceeded to ask where the chicken sandwiches were (as they were in the car) and wanted proof that all we got was the chicken sandwiches.

268,Popeyes,4.0,"Hey guys, I don't typically write reviews about fast food chain restaurants because I rarely eat at them. I felt compelled to write a review for Popeyes due to the craze surrounding the new chicken sandwich that recently debuted and have made rounds on social media like a wild fire. 

I have lined up for half an hour for  ramen, maybe even more, but I have never lined up for a chicken sandwich. Would you wait half an hour for a chicken sandwich? What's the big deal with Popeyes new chicken sandwich and the social media craze with some places being sold old until September, stressed stressed employees, people selling the sandwich for a ridiculous amount of money on eBay, some guy trying to sue the chain because he couldn't get a hold of a sandwich he allegedly purchased from an employee and not only the sandwich was not delivered but he also sustained damages to his car and is being made fun of by his friends. The hype is way way too much! How will the sandwich ever live up to one's expectations?  It can't possibly right? Right? 

Let me just say, best chicken sandwich I have had. I tried the spicy and non spicy and I liked them both, maybe the non spicy a little more. I have had chicken sandwiches where the meat is dry, the meat to bread ratio is off, ones where the buns, and I hate buns, was dry and tasted like it was made in a paper mill, ones where the fry is oily, and ones with weird sauces, not enough pickles, you name it, all the possible things that can go wrong with a chicken sandwich. 

My first thought biting into the brioche bun, again, I hate bun, is that it is actually very tasty. So I am telling myself at this point, yes! Then came the crispy outer layer of the chicken, then the real meat juicy chicken fillet, and plenty of sour pickles. I am digging it! So yes guys, the Popeyes chicken sandwich is a must try. If you hate it for any reason other than simply hating it then you and I and wired differently. 

This isn't just a review of the chicken sandwich. I eat Popeyes about once a year. No particular reason other than the potential weight gain if I have it more often. And the Everett location is the closest to where I live. It's on route 16, plenty of parking, line is not too too bad. For fast food, they have really good fried chicken. Fries are okay, my one true love will always be Burger King fries and then when I am wearing my fancy pants, the truffles fries from Crave- Mad for Chicken in Chinatown Boston. I also don't get that sick feeling after eating the fried chicken that I do after eating at KFC. I also like Popeyes string beans and definitely the pickled jalapeño. They also have Dr. Pepper, my favorite soda. And the apple pie was small but it's all you really need. It reminded me of the apple pie I had at a Macdonald's in London. It's so unfair. You'd think Americans would eat that up more so than the English no? So why is their apple pie better than the ones sold at McDonalds here? But I digress. If I could, I would eat at Popeyes at least once a month but you see, I have self control. And I know the addiction can be real. Once you start you can't stop. Where's my Pringles at?

Spicy Chicken Sandwich ($4.27)
Huge piece of fried chicken with spicy mayo and pickles. The chicken was juicy inside and very crispy outside. The spicy mayo was the perfect amount of light spice. I have no complaints at all and I'd definitely get this again!

Got there at about an hour after they opened and there was probably about 20 people in line ahead of me (this place could use a drive thru btw). Line moved fairly quick and they limit each person to only two sandwiches which is genius. I got two spicy ones. One for me and one for me immediately after. 

The buttered bun was good. The chicken was juicy but for the most part, it's just a regular Popeyes chicken. Started to get disappointed because it wasn't spicy at all. Then I got to the sauce and that was the game changer. I finally understood the hype. Sandwich is pretty big for $4 and it even got me wondering how many calories each sandwich must be.

277,Popeyes,2.0,"Everyone has been raving about their chicken sandwiches so I decided to give them a try. To be honest, I haven't been to Popeyes in years before this and I could still careless about it. 

Their chicken sandwich is so generic. I really don't understand what is so special about it. It's already premade and packaged, ready to go which I didn't like. I hate pickles and the fact that there was already pickles in there and we can't customize it was a big no for me. Even taking the pickles out, I still tasted the pickles. I do have to say the chicken was pretty juicy but the bun was really greasy and oily.

Their fried chicken on the other hand was good. Their fries are great. But would I come back? Probably not. It's not something I would crave or want to eat regularly. I would much rather eat chick fil a.

Service was good though, I came around 10:30am and the workers were ready to go and prepared which is always a plus at a fast food place.

284,Popeyes,1.0,"While I realize there's a pandemic going on, the staff of this location does not care about service or quality whatsoever. I guess with limited options, why care?

At 9PM on April 15th, everything in Merritt Island looked closed. My pregnant wife was in labor, but we were sent home from the hospital due to her not being ready. Both of us were exhausted and very hungry, but she was also in pain from contractions. We needed something quick to take home.

We spotted Popeyes was open and people were in line. We were excited to finally get a chance to try the chicken sandwich we had heard so much about. In hindsight, this was a critical mistake, but we needed food and didn't think we'd find anywhere else open due to unusual circumstances.

The line was moving sloooowly. We weren't sure what the delay was because we could see the staff behind the counter. There looked to be about 6 people working. Once we got to the speaker to order, I had to repeat what we wanted several times till it was repeated back to me. A chicken sandwich meal with an unsweet tea and an extra solo chicken sandwich. Not complicated. 

While making our way around the building, a staff member was spraying out some sort of grease catcher right next to our car while balancing this large, stainless steel tub on top of a rolling trash can right outside the back door. Thanks for the bonus making us extra nervous during a night of grief.

After some time, we finally made it to the window. The young woman working repeated some wrong order to us. I had to re-order our food for about the 4th or 5th time now. While she rang us up and went to get the food, we could clearly see why there was a delay. The whole staff was goofing off with the manager and not caring about the slow moving line wrapped around the building. The woman hands us our bag of food and proceeds to stare at us blankly. I had to ask for our unsweet tea. She gets wide eyed saying, ""OH!"" and goes to get it. Comes back and asks, ""Unsweet??"". Good lord, Popeyes. Finally we get our drink and get out of there.

It took us ~35 minutes from start to finish. The tea was sweet, old and had no ice. The sandwiches were sweaty and soggy from self steaming in the baggies they come in. They resembled mush. There was no point in trying to go back after all this and wait in line again (plus the doors were locked to the dining room). We just wanted to turn in for the night considering all the aforementioned circumstances.

The whole experience was terrible. This location is absolutely awful. We will never dine from there again and I wouldn't recommend anyone else do so either.",-0.022380952380952387,Neutral

While I wouldn't get into a fight for one of these, they were delicious and I understand what the hype is about.  I enjoyed my perfectly spiced spicy version.

I taught them it was poison. So I can say with confidence a three star is a good rating from me. The full extent of that rating comes from my daughter. She is the pickiest eater. I have gone broke trying to find places that she likes to eat. 
The chicken sandwich lived up to the hype for her. She ate it all. Then went in for the Mac and cheese. Delicious she said. I'm guessing it was not out of a box. The jambalaya was full of flavor and had lots of breast chicken. A pleasant surprise. No where near the sausage that the picture showed. Almost non existent really. Portion size is pretty good more than enough to share. The beans and rice was full of flavor clearly some bacon hints in there. 
I can't say it's great but I will say it's good. The biscuit was clearly frozen and then cooked. They slam as much butter as they can in there. Maybe a little too much.

Try the apple pie as well but I rather prefer the Raspberry Cheesecake Pie myself - I usually get about 7 of them ... you know ... to pass around to friends.

Please don't tell anyone!

Listen - this chicken sandwich is the real deal hands down - shut yo mouth!!!

Popeyes is second to none & I've read about Chic-Fil-A (will try it once the border opens up again) but numbers don't lie!

Popeyes since August 2019 has sold over 200 million chicken sandwiches!!!!!

Yes go ahead & say it - WHOA!!!

Popeyes is king & slaying all competitors who are currently locked up in secret laboratories trying to concoct a better sandwich!!!

McDonald's will launch their new chicken sandwich in the new year & apparently its being tested out right now in the Deep South!

If you think there's a better sandwich out there - let me know about it!!!

For more salivating detail please see my other Popeyes review!

Ask for & try their unique dipping Signature Sauces (there's several options so check the menu list) if required for your fries or even the sandwich.

Popeyes Richmond has just opened up today - with more stores on the way across Metro Vancouver!!!

This location is close to Ikea & Home Depot across the road.

Look for Jordans Home furniture store & right next to it is Popeyes.

Have a chicken sandwich first then you can go off & do all your furniture & home decor shopping.

Like Arrrnuuuld said & I ain't afraid to admit - this sandwich has me ... ""screaming like a little school girl"" about to walk into a BTS concert!

Ugh!!!

290,Popeyes,3.0,"Another CHICKEN place in Richmond and there is a lot of hype about this one so I was excited to get a taste of their bonafide chickennn~~ I LOVE FRIED CHICKEN so got almost EVERYTHING on the menu that was available. 

First the process!
The wait wasn't too bad for 5 days since opening day, only around 30 mins and 15 mins for the food. The ordering was chaotic with so much going on but the staff were quite patient. Though they were very inconsistent, as they ran out of biscuits and offered a free side instead for my boyfriend's order yet when it was my turn, they didn't offer me the same offer and I have pay additional for my side even though I had a platter. But since it's the opening week, it's understandable since I came here for the FOOD! 

The Food! 
I got the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, Butterfly Shrimp, Popcorn Shrimp, Cajun Fries, Mashed Potatoes with Cajun Gravy, Onion Ring and Mac & Cheese.
Let's start with the GOOD. 

The Chicken Sandwich is PRETTY GOOD. Soft and Juicy, the combination of sauces and condiments were perfect. Would come just for Sandwich. The sides like the Cajun Fries and Mac & Cheese were BIG! Fries spiced well and the Mac & Cheese was creamy. The Mashed Potatoes was decent, overall liked their sides a lot so far. 

Now for the things that need improvement...
Now, I actually have tried Popeyes in Ontario before so I wasn't that hyped but with Fried Chicken as the main feature...First, the chicken was DRY. 4/6 Pieces were so dry. Not a lot of spice on the Chicken. The mild chicken was drier than the spicy one, I believe. Popcorn Shrimp was so small that I can barely taste them. The Butterfly Shrimp were much better but even then, with it being almost $8, the portion was small. The Onion Rings were the worst I had. I don't think anyone can ruin onion rings but they sure showed me. The onion part was thick and crunchy (a semi-raw onion?). We all tried one and had to throw the rest away which was sad cause I paid extra for it. 

I know a lot of people have said the food gets soggy fast but we ate it across the street (like a 1 min drive) and our fries were getting soggy already. I feel like it due to the air trapped inside the bag? I would have to try Popeyes once dine in is available again since I feel like it's a place for dine-in more.

Ever wondered what's in the Popeye's tent? Nothing. Just the aroma of freshly fried chicken to lure you in and convinces you not to leave the line. Visualize a mime doing its rope act.

The outside line actually wasn't that bad. It took 13 minutes and we're through the door. The line might look long because of the 2m social distancing in effect.

We got in, ordered our food and waited. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. They have a lot of staff prepping and making food so it's more efficient than, let's say, another chain's Cyber Monday deal where peeps waited 2+ hours in line to get their order.

There were quite a bit of people inside waiting for their order to get called up. Orders that are just regular combos gets sent out pretty quick. But if the order includes family meals of fried chicken then expect to wait a little longer. 

It took about 10 minutes to get what we ordered which includes 4 chicken sandwiches and a 16 pc meal. We opted for no sides because they ran out of biscuits and that's the one we would like to try. So no biscuits review this time.

The chicken sandwiches are really good. Juicy, tender fried chicken with mayo and pickles--Mmm! Hype confirmed. Options, mild or spicy. Mild, is just regular, no heat. We got 2 plain chicken sandwiches, no pickles or mayo for the kiddies. 

The fried chicken is good. It's a mix of white and dark meat, all juicy and tender. Nothing special. We'll stick with our KFC (Korean Fried Chicken).

When you can see Popeyes is everywhere on social media, you know the hype is no joke. I am so excited that Popeyes finally launched their first location in Richmond, that means I'm 15 mins away from the true deliciousness without driving all the way to surrey or poco!

At @popeyesca We ordered:
5pcs spicy chicken w/ mashed potatoes 
5pcs regular chicken w/ Mac & Cheese 
1 spicy chicken sandwich &
1 regular chicken sandwich 

I see the battle here: 
Church's chicken or Popeyes? For me so far, I'll def take Popeyes over church's.
Popeyes chicken remind me of the chicken that I had in Asian KFC: they are tender, well-seasoned, crispy and not overly oily. You just can't help to eat more and more until you devour all of them. 

My favourite is definitely the spicy chicken sandwich. A great chunk of fried chicken is stuffed in the middle, with their special dressing and pickles. The buns are soooooo soft that you'll def fall in love with it right away. I didn't feel too heavy after a few bites on the sandwich, which I like it a lot.

My least favourite item among my order would be the mashed potatoes. I mean don't hope up a lot on a fried chicken specialist to make everything perfectly; as long as they do their job right, that's the whole point. I can't even complain :)

Have you tried Popeyes before? FYI they will still open on Christmas Eve and even Christmas. Yea, it might not be the food that you need for Christmas, but def will be the food that you crave! Life is short, just love yourself some fried chicken! Merry Christmas guys!!

However, everything else is fan-freaking-tastic. Service is quick and friendly and the food is spiced and marinated to perfection. They even have blackened chicken tenders for people looking for a low carb, low fat option, and there are more than just fries to the sides.

All of this pales to the new King of Sandwiches - the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich. It's an extra crispy boneless chicken breast on a brioche bun with a pickle or two. You get to choose from classic mayonnaise or a spicy Cajun dressing that has the skeletal remains of Truett Cathey shaking in its boots. Mine was even better because they ""messed up"" my order. I asked for spicy and they put mayonnaise on, THEN they added the Cajun. So I got the best of both worlds!

I sat in the drive thru line for about 15 minutes waiting for the location to open. Instead, I saw an employee through the glass, seated at a table eating breakfast. Other employees continued to arrive late for their shift as well, which is why I decided to leave. On another occasion, I ordered 2 spicy chicken sandwiches. They were sold out-no problem! However, they were also sold out of chicken wings, macaroni, and Coca Cola. After being bombarded with multiple ""no's"" during my order, I decided to not order anything at all and to finally cut ties with this Popeyes location!",-0.1875,Negative

310,Popeyes,3.0,"Popeyes' chicken sandwich came out on August 12, 2019 and there was a lot of hype surrounding it at the time. I saw, read, and heard about the long lines and long waits to get the sandwich. I let several months pass before deciding to give the sandwich a try. It happened at this location, Popeyes store #192.

This Popeyes is located just off I-85 exit 91 (Clairmont Road) at the corner of Clairmont and Briarcliff. It's been around for as long as I can remember. It's a somewhat small restaurant with limited, but adequate, parking. We ordered using the drive-thru. There were only two cars ahead of us when we pulled into the drive-thru lane.

We ordered two chicken sandwich combos so we could try both flavors (there are only two). We ordered the #8 Classic Chicken Sandwich combo and the #9 Spicy Chicken Sandwich combo. Both combos were $6.49 each and each included a side and a drink. A chicken sandwich alone was $3.99.

Like Chick-fil-A, Popeyes' chicken sandwiches were served inside foiled-lined paper sleeves. In short, the sandwiches were good. I'd order them again. However, I think Chick-fil-A's sandwiches are better. The difference between Popeyes' classic chicken sandwich and its spicy chicken sandwich is the sauce. The classic comes with mayo and the spicy comes with spicy mayo. Each sandwich came with two pickle slices. The mayo and pickles were placed atop the bottom bun, beneath the chicken fillet. In contrast, Chick-fil-A sandwiches do not come with any sauce. Chick-fil-A sandwiches also come with pickles placed atop the bottom bun.

Based on this one experience, I think Chick-fil-A chicken sandwiches (which I've had countless times over the years) are superior in terms of taste and texture. They've really got it down. Also, Chick-fil-A's bread holds up better. The bread we got on these two sandwiches was relatively dry and broke apart easier when compared to Chick-fil-A bread.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed these Popeyes sandwiches. They had decent flavor and the pieces of chicken, to me, were meatier than the pieces of chicken in Chick-fil-A's sandwiches. There was more lean meat in them. Popeyes' spicy chicken sandwich is also spicier than Chick-fil-A's spicy chicken sandwich. Note Chick-fil-A's spice is applied directly around the chicken fillet whereas Popeye's spice is in the sauce. Popeyes wins for having the crunchier batter. And I think they have bigger, thicker pickle slices too.

TL;DR version: If you haven't tried Popeyes' chicken sandwich yet, I think they're tasty and worth trying.

As for the sides, we got coleslaw and onion rings. There was a $0.20 upcharge on the rings and the receipt specifically specified there would be only six rings. The slaw and rings were fine. I almost always order slaw when eating Popeyes. It helps balance out the fried chicken for me. The rings were average at best (nothing to write home about). As a bonus, we got free Cajun fries. I think they may have put the fries in our bag by mistake. Whatever the case, we ate 'em all. Popeyes fries are alright. I do like the coleslaw though.

We got a Coke and Diet Coke with our combos. They tasted a little flat and watered down. Below average and slightly disappointing. The cups and lids were pretty flimsy too. The lids easily came off which isn't good when you're driving.

Service was A-OK.

In the end, when it comes to chicken sandwiches and the overall dining experience (drive-thru included), Chick-fil-A wins, in my opinion. Not only are Chick-fil-A's sandwiches better overall, but so is their service (more polite and better-trained employees). And their stores, inside and out, are nicer and better-maintained.",-0.047998768472906364,Negative
311,Popeyes,1.0,"Marques Terry, who identified himself as the district manager, was extremely loud, rude and disrespectful to me on August 5, 2020, around 7:30pm EST.

I'd placed an online order through the Popeyes app as part of the T-Mobile Tuesday promotion, and planned to supplement the order with additional items at the window.

When I got to window, I told the cashier (a woman, not Mr. Terry) that I'd placed an online order and gave her my name. She then proceeded to search for my order, verbally stating that she could not find the name in the system (though the name she kept repeating was not my name).

 Mr. Terry then approached the window and told me ""it's a hit or miss, and we haven't seen an order for your name"". I informed him that the name she kept repeating was in fact not my name. He then said (without searching), ""well I know your name hasn't come through for an order. It's a hot or miss.""  I try to inquire about why the order hadn't gone through on his end and tried to show him the confirmation on the Popeyes app and he told me to ""get out his line"" and threatened to call the police when I asked additional questions about the glitch. This all occurred in perhaps 2 minutes or less (after being in line for maybe 10 minutes). 

I still wanted to place an order (having drove all the way there), but he kept telling me to get out his line (despite my card in hand). He not once asked me if I still wanted to place an order and ignored my saying I wanted to do so at least 2-3 times. 

While the promo was nice, I have more than enough money to pay for a chicken sandwich and two pieces of chicken. 

Not once was I loud or disrespectful to him. 

I'd give this place 0 stars if I could.",-0.09166666666666666,Negative
312,Popeyes,2.0,"This review is for the location at the corner of Briarcliff and Clairmont Road.

We have patronized this location very few times during the 12 years that we have lived in our subdivision nearby. The reason is the consistently disappointing experience.  Today's visit was no different.

The interior dining area was open for patrons to enter and order takeout however upon driving into the small parking area there were employees smoking right at the door. Not a great impression and I am sensitive to the smoke so I chose to enter the drive through.

Ultimately it was a 31 minute ordeal from point of entry until receiving my food. Once you enter the drive through you are trapped since there isn't an adjacent lane to depart. The lane and parking area are small and tight.

Once I arrived at the speaker a garbled voice asked for my order. Due to the poor audio quality I specifically spoke loud and slow to make sure that my order was understood. I wanted the #9 Spicy chicken combo with Diet Coke and the #11 shrimp combo with Diet Coke.

Midway in a sentence the voice interrupts me and tells me to hold on. The speaker was still active so I could hear her arguing with someone else that was already at the window for food.  I had to repeat my order three times in order to make sure that she understood my order. Then she informed me that they were out of Diet Coke- ironic since there were promotional signs in the windows and landscaping promoting Diet Coke- running out of a popular drink at 6pm on a Wednesday is inexcusable.

Upon arriving at the window a young server without a mask asked me what I had ordered- not exactly confidence inspiring and I made a mental note to pull into a space and check the order before leaving.

My food was handed to me on a tray with minimal conversation.  I asked for the dipping sauce and ketchup that I had already clearly requested three times when I was ordering at the speaker since both were missing from my order.  The fact that I had to ask four times for condiments made it clear that this crew of employees lack attention and organization.

At no point in any verbal communication with the employees did anyone ever say ""thank you "" or ""please "" or any other pleasantries- the complete opposite of the service experience at competitors nearby such as Chick  fil A or Newks.

I pulled into a parking space and checked my order and everything was correct.

I live five minutes up the road so the food was still hot and fresh when Mark and I removed everything from the bag.

Mark said his spicy chicken sandwich and fries were good. My shrimp basket with fries and biscuit and the buffalo dipping sauce was good as well.

Obviously we are in a pandemic and it's common knowledge that patrons will prefer drive through service so a 31 minute ordeal is unacceptable and they need to plan better.  Had there been space to depart the lane I would have abandoned the process after the 15 minute mark.

The employees need customer service training and training on organizational efficiency.

I cannot recommend this location.",0.08260350760350761,Positive
313,Popeyes,2.0,"Okay so this is the Popeyes on Clairmont road. Now I know what I'm getting with popeyes, I'm not expecting some top notch service but WHEW.

So I went to popeyes to eat and one thing about me is that I HATE drive thru's. It's just not my thing so I always try to walk in. I get that you wanna close early, I get that you gotta clean up, etc., all of that. BUT if the door is open, let the person in and just lock it after u realized u made a mistake. It's your L, hold it gracefully. They ain't do that.

So I don't know WHO designed this place but they need to catch some hands because I decided to go in the drive through. By now I was still okay but here's why I hate this particular one: YOU COULDNT ESCAPE. About 5 minutes in, I realized I made a grave mistake by not leaving. I was literally STUCK in the drive thru for a hour. I couldn't back up, I couldn't pull out to the side, NATHAN, just stuck. 

So now I had to simmer in my L for this food with a eat ass face cause I wanted some chicken. Okay fine, whatever, I tried to take my L gracefully, but now we get to the window.

These ppl got my WHOLE order wrong. Like the entire thing. They gave my roommate a box of chicken with no fries, no biscuit, and not spicy. He tried to tell them they not spicy, but the didn't even look at him at first. When they finally acknowledged it, they tried to give us a bullshit excuse about there's no difference. If it's one thing you not gonna do is take me and my friends for idiots. Take us on a date, take us on a ride, cool, BUT don't not take us for idiots.

So after a hour of being captive, at least have the order correct, that's it. That's the least you can do. Literally no part was right and y'all were strong and wrong about it. Lastly, STOP charging for sauce. Let's not act like all that fried food ain't gonna need some sauce to go with it. The chicken sandwich had ppl brawling outside, don't be stingy.

Anywho I'm not gonna play myself and act like I'm not gonna go there anymore but just be aware what you getting into when you decide to step into that drive thru.",-0.0538515406162465,Negative

Spicy Chicken sandwich - What a disappointment! The chicken itself is not even up to Popeye's standard chicken that I am used to ordering. It is salty as heck and has a weird texture to it.

How'd it turn out?

Service - surprisingly slow given the amount of activity behind the counter and the long line. 

Food - they were out of the spicy chicken sandwich. I guess the classic will do. They were also out of mashed potatoes (like whaaat?). 

So how was the sandwich? Interesting. There were all pre-made and tossed in bags wrapped in a sheet of paper that vaguely smelled like wet cardboard. The sandwich was also lukewarm and not hot. Likewise there was a distinct lack of crispiness - more like a mush of breading on the sandwich. The bun was slightly chewy in texture and sweet. Even so, the sandwich was seasoned decently.

325,Popeyes,2.0,"This is a location that is on my route when I am doing curbside pickups, etc. I had the Spicy Chicken Sandwich at another location and it was not too bad for fast food. I stopped here as The Lady was on the mend from an injury and wanted me to pick up something for lunch.

Well, the drive through was jammed, but I had not been at this location before and I wanted to see the preparation, handling, masks, gloves, etc. for the order. So, I thought what they hey, I might as well get one also as I was not going to have time to get a nutritious Chicharron taco on the way home.

So with my mask on, carrying my sanitizer, in I went. Tables were spaced out and I was alone. The manager, who was wearing a mask as were all the other staff, was trying to get the touchless pay pad at the front to work. He was struggling as hard as he could and had been on hold to their tech people, but he still tried to take care of me. I could pay cash if I wanted to order inside. OK, did that.

The order was out in less than 60 seconds. These were whole pieces, looked premade, slopped in a sauce, and crammed into the little weird bag that is used to try and keep them worm. I got home, they were soggy, like left out in the rain, kind of thrown together, so I took the chicken out and reheated just the chicken, replaced, cut the sandwiches, and we proceeded to eat. Not good. Not horrible, but The Lady only ate part of hers. 

So to the rating. 1 Star definitely for their efforts in enforcing C-19 worries.   Everyone I saw who got near food had gloves, all had masks, sanitizer was present, no straws or napkins for others to handle, (they gave it to you from behind the counter). The 2nd Star was for the customer service. The workers, understaffed, were working their hearts out for the long drive up line, and the manager's quick response to get me served was solid.

The sandwich I did not like. Destination compost. The construction, sloppy soggy packaging was a disaster.  It might be different if you ate it immediately there.

I don't knock points when confronted with employees because I understand the retail and restaurant industries is a tough job, BUT this person and I guess the whole staff were just delivering and performance a less than average job.

So after we awkwardly stood there waiting for our order to be ready, a group of guys came in and also all ordered the sandwiches. The guy in the back began taking the sandwiches and literally slamming them on the counter in front of us one by one. After slamming 4 of them, he went back to grab more and started throwing them to the counter. I have never seen anything like this before! Everyone in line had no idea what to do or say so we all just nervously laughed and hoped our sandwiches weren't completely ruined.

Unfortunately, it sucks. This visit, the service wasn't bad but I was overcharged (albeit just by a dollar) but the food (chicken sandwich, red beans and a wing) was poor quality. Should have taken a picture but wing was very dry and bland, red beans were watery and  the sandwich was also dry.

I am not a fast food fan, but she has only been out of the house a couple of times since the virus time began, so, OK, we can go there but how about (named several other places to no avail).  Off we go. Only a couple of miles where we be located. We arrived at 1158 :-( which meant lunch rush. There was no eating inside of course, but they were doing a caravan of cars in the drive up and pickup. We sat in the drive up, and waited and waited. Vehicle after vehicle would take an eternity making up their mind and making multiple changes. This did have one benefit as by the time they pulled up to the window the orders were almost immediately ready. The Lady had the new Spicy Chicken Sandwich, and I got the same thing but had the combo with coleslaw and a Dr. Pepper. As usual to expect at a drive up, the order was not correct but the friendly lady at the window quickly corrected. Friendly service and fast, 1 star. We drove off and parked to eat (I carry an emergency Menudo and BBQ kit in the car so we had all the utensils we needed. The food was hot. OK, that's looking pretty good. The sandwich is a waste of money. Road Gizzards would have been much better but that is not offered. While spicy, in our eyes it totally missed the mark. Do we plan on another? No. The coleslaw was quite good as was the Dr. Pepper. So one star there and none for the sandwich. We did eat it all as we were hungry, but friend, there are better sandwiches out there.

Okay, so now about that sandwich. I got the classic, since I can be wimpy about spice and just wanted to try it in a more plain jane fashion for my first time. The sandwich is actually really good. I'd say it's my favorite of the fast food chicken sandwiches. The bun was nice and soft, but not soggy. The chicken was a large piece that was crunchy on the outside, and juicy on the inside. The flavor was good and I really liked the thicker sliced pickles. My only complaint is that there's no option to add cheese. I feel no sandwich is complete without cheese, and this one would be amazing with some pepper jack or smoked cheddar in my opinion. The mayo also was good and not excessive.

The spicy chicken sandwich was wonderful.  This sandwich consists of a normal fried piece of chicken, but it's the sauce they put on it that makes it spicy.  The sauce reminds me of Outback's Bloomin' Onion sauce, but a lot spicier.  These sandwiches definitely have a kick to them so beware if spicy foods aren't really your thing.

This one wasn't too far from my route that day, and I've been wanting to try the much-hyped sandwich.  Well, kinda.  I didn't want to fight crowds, and I knew it was probably not the best thing since sliced bread.  But, I was curious.  So, I waited, and then took a chance.

I don't much like chicken sandwiches, at least those like this that are tenders on a bun.  They're not structurally sound, so stuff slides around.  If I get a chicken sandwich I tend to get a Wendy's-style, single piece one.  Still, I had to try this.  And it was pretty good.  Two big, thick, tender, uh, tenders, on a decent bun.  I got spicy, which I thought meant the flavoring would be in the meat, but it was a sauce/relish.  It was moderately spicy, not super hot.  A couple of pickle slices added variety and not much else.  The tenders themselves were very good, and stayed together till about halfway through the sandwich, when it all came apart.  I'd rather just have the tenders, especially if I'm eating in the car.

Sided with my choice of red beans and rice, pretty good for a fast food chain.  Sweet tea was very sweet and tasty.  Service was friendly, and super fast. No wait at 2pm.  Place was clean.  Decent access from the road and highway.  There is a door on the right side, though it is hidden; walk around the corner toward the drive-through.  I almost missed it.

I'll be back, for other stuff.  If you like this style of sandwich, it is better than Chick Fil A's and Cane's.  But I'll stick with regular chicken, and tenders.",0.13216964285714286,Positive
395,Popeyes,5.0,"The chicken sandwich battle has become all the rage and I decided to hop on the bandwagon and swing by Popeyes to try out their Classic Chicken sandwich.  I ordered it as is with no exceptions or substitutions.  The sandwich is big, the piece of chicken looks huge in comparison to other chicken sandwiches offered at fast food places.  After my first bite I was hooked.  The breading is crispy and the chicken was hot (not too hot, just perfect).  There were two different sauces on the bottom of the sandwich was a load of mayo with pickles.  The top sauce was something like a mild cajun seasoning.  I didn't ask what it was, as I said, I just ordered the sandwich as is.  The flavors are great together.  I will say, this is definitely the best chicken sandwich I have had from a fast food restaurant.  With that being said, I don't think that all that mayo is at all good for you.  I don't typically do fast food because it overall isn't good for my health, but if I get a hankering for a chicken sandwich I wouldn't put it past me to order a Popeye's chicken sandwich, I will just get it without the mayo and potentially with the other sauce, to cut some calories.

426,Popeyes,1.0,"Always great chicken (obviously), but leadership can ruin everything :-(

Regarding the lead promo on the app as of tonight: Get a Free Chicken Sandwich with Purchase of $10 or more (one per day)

I got a pop--up on my phone this morning that said I could get a free chicken sandwich with $10 purchase. I planned my entire day around it, did my FM shopping across the street timed perfectly to get me in and out by 6:30 before they got crushed. I ordered on the app. I use it all the time. We experienced no hiccups ordering. Except I picked the 3 piece dinner with biscuit and one side (beans and rice) and no drink, so the total was only $9.39. Proof that I had added the promotional sandwich to my cart came when it said I couldn't check out using that promotion as it was under $10 total. So I added an additional $3.99 chicken sandwich to the order, and it worked fine. I had the 3 piece chicken, one biscuit, and one beans and rice (which by the way was never included in the order once I got it home), and one $3.99 chicken sandwich on the ""ticket"" (receipt). The promotional sandwich was not visible, but that didn't bother me since it is free, and therefore not in the total charged. And because, not only did I start the entire order by clicking the picture of the promotion on the app, but I was denied checkout before hitting the minimum requirement of $10 in order to get the promotional free sandwich.

The order was ready so fast that it was sitting in a bag on the counter when I arrived 3 minutes later. But no one ever called my name. They were all frantically busy, but I thought they'd call out my name. I only waited 13 minutes before someone asked me my name, and they said it was already sitting there the whole time.

But the free sandwich wasn't there & I was told they wouldn't give it to me. So I asked to see the boss man.

I can't remember his name tag now, but he said he is the franchisee, so the owner.

I explained what happened, and to my shock, he said his store was not honoring that coupon. It stinks for him that corporate would have the #1 leading add on their country-wide app be a promo that certain stores cannot honor. I fully believe him, BUT as a company owner of a retail store, I also understand that, while it sucks, you just HAVE to honor the corporate coupon. I said he could just write it off. And he said that he could not, that ""they"" take it out of his profits. That blows (if it's true). But I calmly (at first) explained to him that if he could just think from my perspective: Even if it costs you $3.99 (cost would actually be only a buck and change or less), that the reward is the loyalty of a repeat customer (which is evidenced by my order history), and that customer will tell others, etc.  That is the ONLY ""Right"" thing to do. It's literally common sense. If you're a business owner, it's 101.

Instead, he just kept showing me the ticket and saying that if it's not on the ticket, it's not part of the order. Makes sense. But it's not my job to understand how their POS system works or receipt printers.

At this point, I was SO flustered that I said I wanted my ""free f**** sandwich"". I wish I had not stooped so low! He now changed his story that NOW he wouldn't because I cursed. I apologized, but also told him his mask was positioned well below his nose. Common sense is not his strong suit. So he told me, and I'm quoting, ""If I touch my mask I have to change my gloves, and you're the one keeping me here"". This gross flaw in logic had me stymied, so it didn't even occur to me to help him. (i.e. of course you can just change your gloves. You'll have to anyway.) Also, if it slips down just from standing in one place talking with one person, then it MUST be slipping down all the time. This means that not only are his Popeye's employees at risk all around him, but customers certainly are as well.

 When I finally got the tap on my window, I had a bag with a SPICY chicken sandwich and small handful of COLD, broken onion rings on the bottom of the bag. 

I went in, all to just receive the same onions rings, put in a cardboard box and exchanged the SPICY for ORIGINAL (which is what I asked for to begin with) and also had to remind them about the mayo. 

I open the chicken sandwich and it's smaller than anything I have seen about this Spectacular Popeyes Sandwich...it was more like 2 small chicken tenders.

I then asked for my money back. He made me wait while he made someone else's order  then took my food, gave me cash and said nothing more.

It took 15 minutes to get through the drive-thru, which is much shorter than the 2 hour wait times I heard people going through when the chicken sandwich first got released, so I was pleased with the wait. I went ahead and ordered 2 sandwiches, one classic and one spicy, as I decided to go ahead and try both since I know Popeyes have been dangerous to venture into lately and didn't want to be left wondering ""what if?"". 

The experience was seamless. Unlike the online videos of the drive-thru, no one tried to ram their car into mine or cut me in line.

I'm not huge on fast food. However, I do love me some spicy chicken from Popeye's. I don't have one anywhere near me so beyond rarely stop at one. Today I was starving and drove by one so decided to stop.

I saw they have their chicken sandwich available right now and so decided to try it. Did the spicy with fries. Both were good, as expected. Thus 2 stars here instead of 1.

I'm giving this location a low rating simply because of the standards in this restaurant. The place is filthy. Garbage on the floor in the kitchen. Dirty everything.

The eating area also very dirty. Even the walls.

The state of disrepair in the place is also astonishing for a chain. It desperately needs some work. Even one of the menu screens was broken or off.

I ordered and after getting my drinks looked for straws. I stood back in line to wait my turn to ask for one. After taking the order for the guy in front of me, the lady at the register turns around and leans on the metal cooking thing behind her and starts talking to someone in the kitchen. Thinking she was just coordinating something, I patiently waited a couple minutes. And 2 or 3 minutes of her chatting, I finally called her (nicely, ""ma'am""). She came over (not excited). I ask for a straw, I find out they are out of straws.

While eating, theres two restaurant staff outside chatting and smoking. One comes inside and the other leans in (while still holding a cigarette in his hand) and blows smoke in the restaurant and proceeds to talk to customer who is walking toward the door.

I've eaten there a few times simply because it's on my way home from work, it's cheap, and fast food staffs have a lot of turnover so there's a chance it'll be better. 

The Taco Bell fare is horribly assembled, sometimes half out of the tortilla. The folks working there can barely even stuff a burrito supreme. Further, the freshness of the veggies and the tortillas is horrible, even by Taco bell standards. 

The KFC is just plain mediocre, even by KFC standards. My chicken sandwich was memorable--memorable does not always mean good.

The fried chicken breast is my favorite with potato wedges even though the wedges was thin and burnt at times but now they replaced them with fries and the fries are horrible. The fries are seasoned like the wedges but they make the mistake of adding more salt to it. When something is already seasoned you don't need more seasoning. Horrible taste with seasoning and too much salt. I don't like the bland mashed potatoes, the other sides are ok but not ideal to snack on. 
And why give a fork for mashed potatoes? I need a spoon, every location gives me a fork and I end up with at least two spoonfuls of mashed potatoes left inside that the fork can not get. 
The chicken at times taste like it's been in the warmer to long and they still can't coat a chicken in BBQ sauce right. A little dab of sauce on top is all they give you but mayo the chicken is swimming in it, I dislike mayo and always have to ask for it to be removed.

I'm not much of a sandwich person but this tastes pretty good!  But I think I'd rather stick with my regular chicken spot, they appreciate my service.

Other than that, chicken sandwich was delicious: hot, crunchy on the outside and juicy, full of spicy sauce and I loved the pickle!  KFC has some competition in this area because there are places that taste just as good but offer nice service. I think I'd rather stick to KFC's competitor!

I never thought I'd be reviewing KFC, let alone giving it a good review, but this KFC takes the cake for me.

Yes, I frequent KFC. Yes, probably once a week, if not more. How I stay thin? If I told you, it wouldn't be a secret and everyone would do it! 

Everywhere you go, every KFC you visit, the food is the same. That being said, I'm not going to comment on it because we all know what an original recipe chicken sandwich tastes like. Battered fried goodness.

I love the people that work here! Once I get over the embarrassment of having store staff recognize me when I come in, nothing makes me happier than joking around, not having to place my own order (because they know what I order).

I hereby ditch my typical Yelping and the forthcoming is my review of a chain, KFC.  I am trying to keep down on the fast food, but it's hard when you are out and about working all day.  

I was tempted by the new ""Doublicious"" sandwich commercials.  No, it's not that monstrosity that is 2 fried chicken breasts with cheese and bacon.... it's just a normal chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese and some sort of sauce.  The $5 price tag for a combo was solid.

Now, I don't know if KFC just hired models with the world's smallest hands for their commercials or they straight up pulled some false advertising, but this sandwich looks BIG on TV, and is teeny tiny in reality.

They rave about the bun that it's on, but it ultimately dominates the flavor of the sandwich.   It's too sweet, and with the chicken breast being smaller than advertised, all you taste is bun.

So, that sandwich gets a 1-out-of-5 stars for me.  The only redeeming points were the mac-n-cheese (got it as a side instead of fries) and their hot sauce (surprisingly good).

-Most people go to KFC for Tuesday Special, so it is very important for this store to be prepared for the long line-up and stocked up on the spicy flavor. This store has done that during the busy hours but not during the last few hours which is understandable.

-The store is generally clean with just a bit of mess at the soft drink dispenser.

-Customer service is exceptional. During my visits, most of the time, the front counter staffs are really nice and welcoming. My orders are always correct and delivered within a reasonable waiting time.

-Now, let's talk CHICKEN! Juicy, crispy and spicy!  The chicken thigh & drum are supposed to be the best in any Fried Chicken store. So these are the food items that make KFC good. The flavor from the thigh & drum in this KFC store taste pretty good to me when compared to the chicken I got from Church's...However, the chicken sandwich wasn't so nice...the chicken that I got in the sandwich actually had squished up skins and look whitish...it had some weird taste...definitely not the normal yum taste from just the separate chicken thigh & drums.

I would recommend this KFC store in the Broadmoor Village, because it has pretty consistent flavor for the chicken thigh & drum separate pieces.

When I got my order I noticed the chicken sandwich was very small. This was not a regular chicken sandwich. This should have been on a dollar menu for that size. On top of that I could tell sandwich has been sitting in the warmer or the chicken was already prepared and they just put it together when I ordered. Chicken was tough and bread was hard as well. I am giving 2 stars for the good service I received at the window and for decent fries. But the sandwich was simply a disappointment. I can guarantee this sandwich will never give chick fila or Popeyes any kind of threat. This is no match to all the other chicken sandwiches out there. No reason for me to go back to kfc.

Donut Chicken Sandwich 
Two glazed yeast donuts with a piece of fried chicken. The donuts were warm and kind of fluffy though a little dry in the middle (and on the parts without the glaze). The glaze seemed to be added fresh after ordering but it was super runny--more like a sauce--and made a huge mess.

The sweetness of the glaze was OK with the chicken, but I probably wouldn't get this again.

I've always been a fan of KFC original recipe chicken; I find the crispy version flavorless. I usually don't order sandwiches, because I associate them with the awful ones served at Chick-fil-A. But I do like to put potato chips into any sandwich, and I like Cheetos. So...

Of course I had to try this new item at KFC, and I really liked it. The chicken is moist and flavorful with a nice crunchy coating, and the Cheetos add even more crunch. Mayo gives it a creamy consistency, and there is an orange sauce that might be intended to be hot sauce, but I would have liked to be spicier.

Overall I enjoyed the sandwich and would have it again.

Bun wasnt as good in my opinion as the brioche style buns at Popeyes or the Sonic slider but still pretty good. Had a little sweetness to it though and reminded me of a Kings Hawaiian bread. The chicken was tender and juicy, perfectly KFC fried and could be near perfect but unfortunately this sandwich had too much Mayo for my taste. The pickles were crisp and enhanced the flavor of the sandwich well. Simple and plentiful. So, why the 3 stars? Good question and I'm sure I could bump this up with another attempt - I ordered the spicy chicken and actually confirmed spicy 3 times and still received the original chicken one. It was still finger lickin' good though. This sandwich is BIG too and literally kept me entertained from Glisan in Portland all the way back to WA side of east Vancouver so yes, it's a good size sandwich and at $3.99 a value priced at that sweet spot as a direct competitor to Popeyes.

If I'm craving KFC Flavor then yes, definitely would and hopefully To try their spicy one next. 3 stars for failing to provide me the spicy one I asked and repeated myself during order so I may modify this rating later after another visit.

I'm in North Georgia with some friends going camping. We stop at a KFC to try out the Nashville Style Hot Chicken tender bucket. We are planing an extensive hike for later in the year and decided it would be interesting to have hot chicken shits in the woods and a test for the future. [1]

I run down the flight of stairs and arrive at the front door, I can feel the sun baking my legs as light pour into the room. I notice specks of red vomit splattered on my calf's, like blood from a fallen angle covering me.

(How was your order?)

I venture back into my bubble, safe from the outside dimension, but left up fully to my own devices.

I've been rewatching Bojack horseman, seems fitting for the time. I hit play as I stuff my face with whipped potatoes, bits of fried chicken, corn, and cheese all swimming in a pool of grease and chili powder. Like a feral animal, I lick the bowl clean, and start on the next bowl of empty bliss. 

I've chosen this life, for better or worse.

The manager said yes you can choose a crispy chicken sandwich chicken nuggets fries and a drink, so I got my meal came home with it and fries were stone cold, to the point of a couple of them feeling like they were still half frozen when you bit into them, and keep in mind I live about four minutes away from the Wendy's, chicken nuggets were stone cold and the chicken sandwich was lukewarm at best, tried to get a cherry Coke didn't have it,tried to get a vanilla Coke didn't have it.

519,Wendy's,1.0,"Worst service ever! A couple of days ago I order a chicken sandwich and a double (No Cheese) went over the order twice and corrected them when they repeated the order the first time. The chicken was very dry. It was like trying to chew on a shoe sole. The double, of course, had cheese on it. It was so frustrating. I decided to call and complain to the manager. I spoke with GM Sean. Sean was very apologetic. He admitted that they have been having issues with the Homestyle Chicken being too dry. He said he was very sorry that my order was filled incorrectly and invited me to have my next meal free. I asked if there is some incident number I needed to give them. Sean said, just tell them sean said to give you a free order and they would be happy to give it to you.
Well... Today I decided to take Sean up on his offer.  They take my order and ask me to pull forward because it will take 6 minutes for a fresh sandwich. sean was not in but another manager was there. I told her Sean told me that the order was to be free but to my surprise, a minute later she sends a young man to have me pull back around so I can pay for the balance of my order. When I got back to the order window she started arguing with me.  She said she can ""replace"" my chicken sandwich because it was dry but she was not going to take care of my burger too. I could not believe the audacity of this young woman. I thanked her for her time and suggested she keep her food. I will never come back to Wendy's.

So it was really my first time eating at this Wendys.  I got the a $9 grilled chicken sandwich combo.  To their credit, the fries were hot.  But the chicken on that chicken sandwich was almost invisible.  After I remove half the bread from the sandwich so it fit that tiny patty, I basically paid ten dollars for a chicken slider.  I could have gone to a sit down restaurant for these prices.

524,Wendy's,4.0,"If you follow my reviews, you will know that Wendy's is one of my favorite fast food restaurants for their ""better quality"" fast food.  I'm not talking about the value items, but specifically about their salads and premium chicken sandwiches.

I have been to this particular Wendy's several times while visiting different friends who live nearby.  However, I've only been through the drive-thru, so I'm not sure what the inside looks like.  Most recently, I went through the drive-thru here around 7 pm on a Friday while I was on my way to a friend's place nearby.  I ordered my favorite meal - the Spicy Chicken Fillet Sandwich Combo ($6.09 for the ""Small"" combo).

There were two cars in front of me, and although it felt like it took a long time to finally get to the pickup window after ordering and paying, it actually took about 5 minutes from the time I ordered to the time I got my food.  I asked for two sauces - a Buttermilk Ranch and BBQ sauce (so delicious when they're mixed together!), which I always dip my fries in.  Some Wendy's restaurants actually charge for sauce (unless you order chicken nuggets), but this one doesn't.  I always appreciate that.  =)

When I arrived at my friend's place to eat about 10 minutes later, my sandwich and fries were still pretty hot.  I enjoyed my meal and was, for the most part, satisfied.  The only suggestion I have for this Wendy's - and perhaps all Wendy's in general - if for them to PLEASE get Coke Zero as one of their fountain drink options!  I recall when I was living in L.A., they served Coke Zero for a while, and then they stopped.  Please bring Coke Zero back!

Overall, this Wendy's gets 4 stars for their fairly quick, friendly service and delicious food.  I will definitely return to this Wendy's time and time again when I'm hanging out with friends who live in the area.

528,Wendy's,2.0,"Out of the big three in the fast sorta-food market Wendy's is the best, or the closest to actual food. We know it. After all, it's a hometown product and proves the Columbus rules the sorta-food category.  

I know I don't mind Wendy's, their 'spicy' chicken sandwich is pretty delicious. I stopped by for just a little bite seeing their 4 for $4 deal: a Junior bacon cheeseburger, small fry, small nugget, and soda. It totals at $4.30 with tax. 

This location like others has undergone remodeling, ditching the bland interior for something you actual might want to eat in; glass, TV, a fireplace, pseudo-upscale seating attempting to stem the loss of clientele by the fast-causal competition. All this is nice but is ultimately worthless if fundamentals are lacking. 

In my trip here fundamentals were lacking. 

1.) All the pleasing interior designs in the world will fail if much of a customer's experience is spent watching the employees work in their miserable assembly line of bells, whistles and alarms.  This is due when the line overwhelms the system and the customer ( that's me on this trip) has to stand and wait for his food, doing nothing but watching the staff hustle among their machines and food parts.  How about a number system where we could at least enjoy the new fancy dining room instead of standing and feeling odd? 

2.) The cashiers need to listen: I said ""for here,"" not ""to go."" I was forced to just eat out of the bag. This is not a critical error, and if it wasn't busy I would had corrected at the counter. But it is a pet peeve and something so simple.

3.) Nothing says low quality than the soda machine having no ice and for the soda to be hooked-up wrong and be flat. Uggg.

4.) though not all that bad, the place was pretty dirty with crumbs in the carpet and straw wrappers tossing about like tumbleweeds. 

Just a bad experience all around.",-0.07454322638146167,Negative
529,Wendy's,1.0,Let me start out by saying the food is pretty good usually (especially the Spicy chicken sandwich) The hamburger buns are a tad harder than I like but I can over look that however what makes this a 1 star review is the way the staff is treated and if you point out something is missing from your order the managers get all accusing like ok you just gave me this bag I just looked in it did I magically hide fries? How workers are treated DOES affect the over all experience because I for one do not want to see the manager Josh(saw his name badge) call the cashier an idiot repeatedly and have the cooks talking in spanish that even though I asked for my grilled chicken straight off the grill they weren't going to listen.I am the customer so yes if I want fresh food and am willing to wait then it's your job to do it.

I'd heard Wendy's had updated their chicken sandwich, and I was nearby, and it's a cold day so I also wanted to get some chili. Service at the drive-thru was pretty quick. They still have a pretty big menu compared to some other places, so that was nice. I was able to swap chili out for the fries, which was also nice. I think there was a small upcharge, but still; I'm not a big fan of Wendy's fries. 

The chicken sandwich was: okay. Is it better than their old one? Maybe a little. Is it better than other fast food chicken sandwiches? Maybe a little. Is it as good as, say, Popeye's chicken sandwich? No. Is it a great sandwich? No, but it's decent. Pretty average bun, pretty decent chicken, pretty average toppings. But, hot, and fresh, and satisfying. Tender meat, okay breading. It was good enough.

I waited another 5 minutes, received my food & left. When I got to the car, we checked our bags & our food was incorrect. Very frustrating! I went back in & explained that our food was not correct- they tried to tell me that I did in fact order burgers when I knew that I ordered chicken sandwiches!

The one thing I can never figure out is if you have someone who has a thick accent, why would have them work the drive thru?

It would be more efficient for the drive thru if you could have someone who can speak clearly. 

I get to the window and my food was ready, which was nice. The fries were soggy and the chicken sandwich I got was hot, but had too much ranch sauce where it went everywhere as I took a bite. You figure if I am going to pay over $7 for a meal, it should not look like it came from the kids menu.

They consistently get orders wrong in the drive through to the point where now it almost seems like they are doing it on purpose.

How do you mistake a strawberry salad for a BBQ ranch salad. It showed up on the screen correctly. Where did you go wrong?

How do you put ""no tomato no ketchup"" on BOTH sandwiches on the screen yet put them on the sandwiches anyway. (allergies to tomato. thanks).

Does spicy chicken sandwich suddenly translate to fish fillet? I guess it does.

The workers in the back seemed to have developed selective deafness for various timers, because they had absolutely no urgency to turn them off or to take care of the orders.  After over 10 minutes of waiting I considered getting back in my car, going through the drive-thru, and wiping the experience from my mind, but I powered through it.

To her credit, the cashier quickly took and retrieved the order for my small #7, though she did struggle at the ""and a package of honey mustard"" part.  Within the next 3 minutes I was leaving with a chicken sandwich, luke-warm fries, and a Coke.  13 minutes inside.

551,Wendy's,1.0,"Wow!  Probably the worst fast food experience ever.   I realize that Wendy's is in a nosedive, but this experience was ridiculous.  I came at 3:30 in the afternoon and there was a line of 4 people.  The two people in front of me left after about 5 minutes of waiting which is the only reason I stayed..,.mistake!

The person taking the orders moved so slow and appeared surly.   She finally took my order and I waited so long for it to be filled I finished my soft drink while I was waiting.  I almost left again after paying I waited so long.

Then, I got my spicy chicken sandwich....what a joke!  The breading was thicker than the chicken.  That was my last Wendy's visit ever.

556,Wendy's,2.0,"This is a summary of my expericence at this Wendy's location for the past 6 months.    
The food is very much the standard Wendy's fair.    Depends on when you visit and who is working, you get either nice and fresh burgers, fries, chicken sandwichs, and chicken nuggets or you get something that seemed to have been sitting there for hours.    For the most part, the food is fine.  
The service at this location is what ultimately drives me away for good.    Out of the 7 to 8 times I have frequented this place, the folks behind the counters are always less than pleasant.     I have been short-changed 3 times when paying with cash.   I can see it was only 0.10 to 0.50 each time, but imagine if they do that to every other customer each day, they are ending up with stealing more than $100 a day in change.     
One time, I was overcharge for an additional burger, they only wanted to refund me the exact amount of the burger, but not the taxes that they had also charged me.    I tried to get the counter-person to understand that when she charged me for an extra burger that I did not order or want, she had also charged me for taxes related to that burger.     She then said she can't open the register to give me my full refund until someone else buys something.    I waited for another customer to buy something before she gave me my money back.    The worst part of it was that she didn't immediately give me my money back, she made me wait until she took care of the other customer and made me feel as if I was wrong,
The last straw came when I bought a meal that was listed for one price, but it rung up for $0.50 more.  So I basically charged $0.54 more for the same item that was advertised.  (No, I did not up size and the price that rung up was not for any up-size)   I told the counter person that their price list indicated this meal would cost such amount as advertised, the price is right there for he and I to see.   He said, sorry, I can't do nothing, it rung up as charged.     I asked to speak with a manager.   He came to the front and asked what is the problem.   After explaining the ""problem"" to him,  there was no apology, he just handed me $0.54.     This leads me to think they know exactly what they are doing at this location,  scamming unsuspecting customers by either short-changing them or by charging more for advertised items.    I had told him that they advertised one price and their registered rung up a different price and that seems kind of unfair and he should fix that.   He said he can't do anything about it.

Except this restaurant is severely understaffed, usually with a single person taking orders for both the drive through and customers in line. It takes a while, and you'll be ignored. I've also had numerous issues with the food, either getting the wrong thing, waiting an inordinate amount of time, and once getting a raw chicken sandwich. So you stand around waiting for that one employee to finally get back to you then get your order right, again after a ridiculously long wait. The understaffing also means the restaurant itself is usually dirty, or there's no ketchup or straws or napkins.

But what prompted me to write today were the aggressive panhandlers INSIDE the place. I was hounded by a woman for money to the point I had to leave, and no one from the restaurant would help out. I offered to buy her some food, but she only wanted money. Would I drive her to the ATM and give her $20? No, I won't.

575,Wendy's,1.0,"I don't even know where to begin. My boyfriend & I witnessed every display of poor customer service in one sitting. We went to this location last night. When we pulled up the drive through line was wrapped around the building so, being a Saturday night we just assumed they were busy so we went inside to eat. At first I was displeased with the monotone, unfriendly vibe I got from the girl behind the counter when we ordered our food but after this horrible experience I ended up feeling bad for the girl because she was basically running the whole place by herself. We ordered or food at 8:54 PM & our fries were brought out after 5 minutes. They have one of those fancy pop machines with the 100 different flavors but none of the flavors were actually available & the pop tasted weird. 15 minutes passed and we were still waiting on our sandwiches. Meanwhile, there were 3 employees standing by the drive thru window not doing a single thing! One of the girls was staring off into space with her HANDS DOWN HER SHIRT, SCRATCHING HER BOOB! The kid who was making the sandwiches was moving at a snails pace & I watched it take him 5 minutes to make a small cheeseburger for the drive thru. Then he WIPED SWEAT OFF HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS HAND & CONTINUED TO MAKE THE DRIVE THRU FOOD! (Luckily he did not make our food & i watched like a hawk while they made our food later) While this is all going on, a manager walks up to another employee & starts talking bad about a man in the drive thru who was upset because he got over charged for his food! IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS! Calling the guy crazy & this & that. Instead of doing his job as a manager & addressing the issue he continued to run his mouth about this man. At this point the line was wrapped around the building for both the drive thru & inside. 25 minutes had passed & we still did not get our sandwiches. The girl who took our order noticed and SHE had to say something to the MANAGER! He then rolled his eyes & gave nothing but attitude about having to do his job. No apology from him, just from the clerk. The 3 other employees were still standing back there doing absolutely nothing. When we FINALLY got our food & sat down to eat our fries were freezing cold, my chicken sandwich was extremely dry & unappetizing, my boyfriend's burger was not cooked through (lucky for them he likes a little pink in the middle but it's still not normal for Wendy's)  before we left my boyfriend went to the restroom & when he came back he looked extremely mad & grossed when I asked what was wrong he said the bathrooms were absolutely DISGUSTING. We left & went to the movies & when we drove back from the movies at 12:45 AM, the line for the drive thru was STILL wrapped around the building. I just am in shock & awe over what we experienced at this location. It is a very convenient location, being right by our house but now we don't know if we ever even want to go back to this store.

576,Wendy's,4.0,"I sometimes ask myself why I bother to write about a chain fast food place, they are supposed to be cookie-cutter restaurants where you get the same thing at every single one across this great land of ours.  Hence, you should be able to say that a Wendy's is a Wendy's is a Wendy's.  Or are they? (picture one eyebrow arching up like Leonard Nimoy). 

The Japanese are credited with saying that a fish starts to stink from the head. actually the earliest known use of the term was by a Greek named Erasmus in 1546.  Obviously that means that if the leadership is bad what does that say about the crew under him or her?  I have been to some bad Wendy's and some that fluctuate, but this Wendy's has been amazingly constant since I started going there in 2002.  They don't stink.

Today however was a new level of awesome.  As you may know I am recovering from surgery and am on a knee scooter.  The Official Mother of this Elite and I stopped for something to eat, she a salad and me a spicy chicken sandwich.  As we filled our cups with soda the cashier had our food ready.  Mom had the drinks in her hands and if you ever try to carry much on a knee scooter you know it's a recipe for disaster.  Mom, carrying our drinks said she would be right back up for the food, but the cashier, even with people in line took a moment and brought our trays out to us without being asked.  That is awesome in my book.

Fries are always good at wendy's, crisp and hot to perfection. The joint was clean, but very dimly lit.",0.04492615227909347,Positive
588,Wendy's,5.0,The hamburgers are juicy and that makes them so good. Good side dishes like baked potato and tasty fries. The beef tastes real but like it was frozen. The chicken sandwiches are the greatest. The specials are good every time they run one.,0.4081632653061224,Positive
589,Wendy's,3.0,"Run of the mill Wendy's sandwiched in between Downtown and South Station. The service is decent and fairly prompt. If you must order anything from Wendy's, their chicken sandwiches are the best of all the chains and seems to be more fresh and flavorful than their competitors. This place has two levels but can be crowded, so you could prolly grab a counter - style seat with limited to no hassles. Otherwise, you could prolly just take it to go and be on your merry way. Remember, chicken sandwiches are the way to go here.

You follow the low ceilings all the way to the back, where the menu boards sit at the bottom of a two-story high wall. Very disorienting but unfortunately not enough to distract you from the occasionally undercooked meat, as was the case with my ""homestyle"" chicken sandwich. Of course, they just replaced it with another ""homestyle"" chicken sandwich, but I figured the chances of getting two undercooked chicken in a row to be low. To be fair, not everything's bad.

There was a sharp dressed (business professional) man assisting the cashier taking orders inside the restaurant. We assumed he was the manager, but turns out he was actually the new District Manager. He not only assisted taking orders at the cash register, but he was clearing tables, delivering food to tables and greeting everyone as they came in. I believe his name was Rashad, I couldn't quite hear him when he said it, due to the restaurant being busy for lunch hour. However, my group complimented him on the amazing way that he was serving everyone and assisting his employees. He was the epitome of leading by example and wasn't afraid to do something that he, himself, would ask one of his employees to do.

594,Wendy's,2.0,"I'm just gonna go ahead and start with the good by sayin everyone here is super friendly. Customer service is great. 

The bad news is that I was there because I was hungry. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich meal, and I'm halfway convince my order came out the dishwasher. My fries weren't even fried. They looked and tasted like they were boiled, not even seasoned. I got a box of naked, limp, boner-killer ""boils"" (can't even call them things ""fries""). It was disgusting. 

The sandwich wasn't AS bad, however chicken was not crispy either. And after looking at my receipt I ended up paying Full price for something I was supposed to get for $1 due to a coupon i had in the app. That's on me. I should know better to pay attention to what they're charging me.

The only reason I didn't bring any of this back and get my money back was because I used the drive-thru and did not feel like driving back to the restaurant.

I get that it's a fast food restaurant that employs kids that ostensibly only care for the paycheck and don't think so quick on their feet...but WOW! Management apparently falls in the same category. Snarky attitudes, hardly any smiles, and apathetic attitudes from folks with a poor self image problem permeate this atmosphere. Snap out of it, perk up, and be interested in your work environment and how efficient and effective you can be at your job. I tried asking how long it would take not for my order but to prepare a certain grilled chicken sandwich. As some places prepare these very kinds of items as they are ordered and tend to need extra time to prepare. Being a fast food joint, I was in a hurry and did not want to place an order that would exceed my allotted time frame available to wait. All I got was confusion and a sir you'll just have to wait as there are people in front of you. Ok, that's not what I was asking...have a good day. I'll go somewhere else.

600,Wendy's,3.0,"Very seldom do I go to Wendy's twice in a week. Let alone two days in a row. But having my car serviced at the nearby Tires Plus, I decided to walk over for lunch. I had been to a Wendy's on the day before. This location, on the corner of Hoffner and Conway, is convenient if you are having your car serviced at the automotive shop mentioned. I have been here a few times, and never have I had any problem in regards to service, food, or cleanliness. And when I have been here, there is a constant flow of customers. Either dining in or getting an order from the drive through window. They must be doing something right.
Whenever I go to Wendy's, I always order the hamburger. But since I had a Wendy's hamburger the day before, I decided to give the new Tuscan Chicken sandwich a try.
The Tuscan Chicken sandwich is a chicken breast served on a Ciabatta roll and topped with asiago cheese. My chicken breast was breaded and spicy. As to whether you can order the breast grilled, I am sorry to tell you that I did not think to ask or look at the menu more closely. It is topped with lettuce and a garlic and roasted tomato aioli, giving the sandwich a more zesty taste rather than the everyday mayo or mustard. Aioli is a spread that consists of spices, oils, and roasted vegetables, such as tomato or red pepper.
Along with the sandwich, I had my usual medium drink and medium order of french fries. Plus a small chocolate Frosty. I think there is a unwritten law somewhere that says you must order a Frosty with every meal you buy at Wendy's. I don't know how true that is, but it works for me! My total for lunch came up to $8.93.
My sandwich was delicious. And I would recommend that if you do find yourself going in to a Wendy's, give this sandwich a try. I would love to have the recipe for the garlic and roasted tomato aioli.
I had finished my lunch and decided to stay for a little bit and read while my car was being worked on. This Wendy's location does not have a soda fountain where you can serve yourself. You have to ask the employees for a refill. They were more than happy to refill my drink, and the management and staff had no problem with me taking my time to leave. I guess if there is plenty of tables and you are not causing a problem, that is fine. I have been to other restaurants in which they are in a hurry to get you to leave. 
If there was any problem with this Wendy's, it would have been the bathroom. There were paper towels all over the floor. But that is more of a problem regarding a few customers. When  business was slow, a few employees came out to wipe down tables, take out the trash, and clean the bathrooms. Any Wendy's I have been to always seems to make cleanliness a priority.
The next time I have my vehicle service, or if I just happen to be nearby, I'll gladly stop in again at this Wendy's. And when I do, I might just get me another Tuscan Chicken.",0.024737453904120566,Neutral

I heard another customer say to his wife, ""Every table in here is filthy!"" and then apparently decided to take their food to eat in their car.  I also saw another customer grab a big wad of napkins and wipe down a table himself before sitting down at it.  Well, that pretty much sums up my feelings too.

616,Wendy's,4.0,"I've been through the drive-thru of this Wendy's a few times, but I've never dined inside.  Nevertheless, it's my absolute favorite Wendy's to date!  Why?  Because not only do they serve my favorite fast food chicken sandwich, they also have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine!  This means I can get my favorite soda - Raspberry-flavored Coke Zero!  =)

Most days when I'm in the mood for Wendy's, it's because I'm craving the Spicy Chicken Fillet Sandwich.  As previously mentioned, Coke Zero is my favorite beverage - probably of all time - and I love that you can get it flavored is so many ways, including (but not limited to) Raspberry, Cherry, Vanilla, Orange, etc.  Wonderful.  Why can't all Wendy's have Freestyle machines?!

The Spicy Chicken Fillet Sandwich and fries (combo = $6.25, including tax) are always served hot and delicious here.  I always get the Ranch and BBQ sauces to dip my fries in.  Mmmm - sooo good!

During my most recent drive-thru experience here, I noticed there was a small sign on one of the pick-up windows indicating that if you make a $1 donation to the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, you'll get a Frosty-shaped key tag to attach to your key chain.  This allows you to get one free Jr. Frosty per visit with any purchase at Wendy's.  I thought this was awesome and told the employee that I wanted to make the $1 donation for a key tag.  However, the employee informed me that this is only valid at participating Wendy's, possibly only Corporate-owned restaurants, which apparently this one is.  That was totally fine by me.

Overall, this Wendy's gets 4.5 stars for their consistently wonderful (better than) fast food, fairly short wait time in the drive-thru, and awesome Coke Freestyle machine!  I can't emphasize enough how much I love that they have the machine because all the other Wendy's I have been to in Georgia don't serve Coke Zero at all!  Since this is the closest Wendy's to work, I'm sure I will continue to utilize their drive-thru on a regular basis.  Free Jr. Frosties for the rest of this year!!!  =)

The woman in front of me was at the window  for so long I found myself cursing...damn lady how much friggin food do you need, but then I noticed her staring back through the side window as if to say... hey! no one's here, so just lay off.  She gave up and drove off.  I went to the speaker waited a bit and then a very exasperated voice came over the speaker asking for my patience, it would be just a minute.  He came back and I ordered, jr bacon cheese, Monterrey chicken sandwich and sm fry.  (yes I am still trying to lose weight and the chicken was a last minute addition -i left my wallet at home and was working off of the dollar menu...it's a new item...I wanted to try it....ANYWAY.)  A large middle aged  guy who looked like he wanted to shoot me, ""Wendy""  herself, the world for making him work this shit can job and definitely his jherri curled supervisor standing directly behind him frowning ...handed me a large red drink. I handed it back... yes I took it...I would have appreciated a nice complimentary coke or tea but not fruit punch.  His supervisors eyes narrowed as it became clear he had made yet another mistake.  Yes you did he insists, his polite voice having disappeared.  You ordered a jr bacon cheese, a chicken sandwich and a large fruit punch.  I shook my head.  I repeated my order with the fries as he glared at me nastily refusing to take the drink his expression saying, I know you ordered that damn jungle juice-. Just f*ing take it. nope. Don't want it. I would have just kept it but still I needed my fries.  He finally relented, the polite voice returned and he came back with fries.   When I asked for ketchup he squished the packets into my hands and I knew he wanted nothing more than to slap me in the face with them.  My receipt revealed that I had paid 1.39 for that stupid drink-more than anything on my actual order and I really wanted to go back and get my correct change, but I didn't.  That guy looked like he was on his last leg, and a verbal lashing from Jherri might have sent him over the edge over a few cents.
Long story short, the service here sucks.  I returned some nuggets once and when my replacement was a few cents more the idiot at the counter insisted that I pay the difference.  For 11 cents?  When I sarcastically handed her my debit card the fool actually started to process the charge until her manager came over and just gave me my food.

Even worse than I remembered. Long lines would make you think fresh food... NOPE! Each time I ordered 4 regular nuggets, 4 spicy nuggets and or a crispy chicken sandwich and fries. All the times the nuggets and chicken patty were limp slightly warm and the fries were terribly undercooked and limp as well. At least they were a little warmer than this chicken products, but still limp and mush.

Everrrrrryyyyyy once in a while, I'll get a craving for some fries or a chicken sandwich.  So the bf had more of a craving than I and asked me to stop by the drive thru one day for early lunch.  

I just got something simple - grilled chicken sandwich and fries.  He ordered  a single with cheese and fries. 

OMG. I cannot tell you how completely DISGUSTING the fries were. They were cold and so full of grease that they went as limp as a dead sea eel. 
And then, after we said NO MAYO, I repeat, NO MAYO, they slathered it on....*green vomit face*....

We couldn't even attempt to eat the sandwich after we scraped off the nasty creamy oily white substance....I don't really even know how to describe the tasteless, grease filled, nastiness of these sandwiches. 

They probably haven't changed the grease in 2 years. This place should be shut down. I am afraid of what the kitchen looks like.

So if your missing a serving tray, yes we took it.  We asked for the order to go, and it was placed on a serving tray.  Again stated it was to go, and it fell on deaf ears!

I was very excited to try a few things on it!  I ordered and the very lackluster person at the other end of the speaker said, ""Breakfast is over"". I guess it must've ended at 10:30 bc it was 10:34. I said ""can you change it over to the lunch menu so I can order from that?""  She said yes. A few minutes later she came out and turned the 5 menu boards. 
I then ordered a crispy chicken sandwich and a double stack. The chicken was not crispy, although it probably was at one time. The lettuce was limp and it tasted like there was no mayo on it, but looking for it, you could see there was some mayo that was sparsely spread on it. 
I knew the burgers on the double stack were going to be small which is why I ordered the double stack. They were very small!  But that's not what the real problem was. They looked old. Not like they were cooked yesterday, but like they were cooked last week, heated up every day, not sold and then heated up the next day!!  They tasted like they had had all of the tastiness, flavor and freshness microwaved right out of them!

I rarely eat at Wendy's but have been pretty tired of cooking lately, so I decided to get something quick, easy and drive-thru.

In the past, I have not been a fan of Wendy's burgers, preferring their chicken sandwiches, but then a few years ago, I stopped even liking those.

Anyhow, I went to Wendy's, got the combo #6 (I do believe) which is the new ""W' cheeseburger, fries and a drink.

For a fast food burger, the ""W"" was quite tasty!  I was super impressed!  I liked the amount of beef, cheese and condiments.  I would definitely eat that again, when the burger mood strikes!

We wanted to check the receipt to see if we were still charged for the fries and realized we were not given our receipt or my card back. We turned around to go back and get my card. We parked in the parking lot not even 2 minutes after we left and saw the girl that had just cashed us out (who didn't give my card back) get in her car and speed off. We walked up to the drive through window and told the other lady that we weren't given our card back and that we also weren't given our correct order (which didn't really matter) she tried looking for the card and couldn't find it. She gave us the food that we were missing (the fries tasted like some kind of chemical had spilled on them) and she called the girl who had just gone on break.

She got out of the car yelling and swearing and went inside. When she came to the window she said ""are you sure I didn't give you your card?"" I said I was positive and told her and the other girl several times the color of my card, my name and the name of the bank it said on it. They then said they found my card and tried to hand me a red credit card with the name Ashley on it.

We asked another question  to the sweet cashier, which apparently the ""manager"" overheard incorrectly and she loudly shouted from the back ""Do they want something else taken off now?"" as if we had inconvenienced her so drastically on a quiet night in which sales would most certainly be down. I could not even control my laughter as I was so surprised at the rudeness of a person in charge of leading others and setting an example. We finally received our food after an uncharacteristically long wait for a franchised fast food restaurant, and exited the store. The food was extremely poor, and the chicken sandwiches almost inedible as they had been made so long ago. All in all, this was by far the WORST Wendy's I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. I certainly hope they can correct the issues, as they seem to start at the top of this particular store.

You people even try to give this ppl any stars make sure you tell them they suck so they fix it.  I'm very picky nobody needs to deal with this, is 2018 and you know what ppl have options.

675,Wendy's,2.0,"I use the drive-thru at this location most of the time, and they're good about getting my order promptly and correct. Today I decided to eat in. Huge mistake. I ordered a spicy Asiago chicken sandwich (no tomato) combo with a baked potato and an unsweetened iced tea. The lady that took my order must have been very distracted because she kept asking me over and over to repeat it. When my order came up, there were fries on the tray. I said I had ordered a potato. The server looked confused but then got me a potato. She left the fries on the tray. I looked at my receipt and it had ""small fries"" on it. I was annoyed because I had repeated my order several times to the cashier. I took my tray and went to sit down, but when I unwrapped my sandwich, there was no tomato but there was no Asiago cheese either. Also, it didn't look like the sandwich was correct/it appeared to be the dollar menu chicken sandwich. I took it back to the server behind the counter and said, ""Isn't there supposed to be cheese on this?"" The server looked at the cashier and she said, ""Yes, Asiago chicken club-that's how I rang it up!"" (It was correct on the receipt.) The cashier and the server apologized and the server said she'd make me a new one right away. She dumped the other sandwich in the trash, which made me cringe-I should have told her it to waste it, that I'd take it for later, but oh well. I figured while I was up at the counter I'd ask for for some butter for my potato. Another gentleman behind the counter asked if I'd been given any and I told him no. He seemed surprised. He disappeared for a few minutes and when he returned, he said they didn't have any. None? That seems odd, a restaurant that serves baked potatoes not having any butter. Hmmm. So I took my sandwich, ate and this time, they got it correct. The disorganization of the place just really unnerved me. I was going to give them only one star, but a different gentleman was going around the dining room and he checked on me and offered a refill on my drink. That got them a second star.

I went there today, Sunday, August 19, 2018 at 1:10pm:

1] It took 20 minutes to go through drive through.

2] I ordered a Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger, a Crispy Chicken Sandwich, and a Small Honest Tropical Green Tea at the drive through. To which, they replied that my total would be $1.75 (which is incorrect).

3] When I pulled up to the 1st window to pay, I reconfirmed my order with the cashier and the cashier says: ""oops, I put down a large tea by accident."" Umm, that price still isn't correct, sir. After he got it corrected, I was told a new total amount of $5.35. I noted that the cashier didn't give me a receipt after the transaction. So, I requested my transaction receipt and the cashier said the second (front) window will have it.

4] When I pulled up to the second (front) window, they initially gave me someone else's order. So, I gave it back and I had to reconfirm my order to someone for a 3rd time. While I was waiting for them to get the right order, another worker came to the window and apologized that they didn't have the syrup for the tea I wanted and asked if I wanted something else. So I got a Limeaid. Well, I got the ""correct"" order, but I still didn't get my transaction receipt. So I requested it a 2nd time and the guy at the front window had to run to the back window to get the receipt. ...Come to find out they put down a ""Small Pear Berry Fruit Tea,"" which they were out of, instead of the Honest Tropical Green Tea that I wanted and a ""Jr. Cheeseburger"" instead of the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger that I wanted.

5] When I got home (only a 5 min drive away) I found that both my sandwiches were cold, stale, and hard.

681,Wendy's,1.0,"Food poisoning!!!!!  

Day before Thanksgiving, my boyfriend went to Wendy's at Tuttle. He had just come from the gym and was feeling great.  He noticed the place seemed poorly managed...just an observation based on the lack of cleanliness and the attitudes and poor customer service by the employees there.  He ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and chili.  When he got home, there was no cheese on the chili as ordered, no crackers, spoon or napkins. The chili was clearly bottom of the barrel...it was basically soup with no meat and just a few beans (the chili was for me).  Within a few hours of consuming the chicken sandwich, he became violently sick..vomiting, cramps, diarrhea.  This continued throughout the next day, Thanksgiving, and we had to cancel family plans as he said he had not been that ill in decades.    The nature and sudden onset of his symptoms leaves no doubt that he had food poisoning.  Because he hadn't eaten anything but his normal foods prepared at home, we determined it was that chicken sandwich.

729,Wendy's,3.0,"I would like to inform any who read this and also the corporate hq of Wendy's that some franchises do not understand the meaning of what is on the back of receipts now days. This not only happens for Wendy's, I have had it happen to me at Rally's, but there needs to be a training program to get everyone standardized. 

I use the back of my receipt and for anyone who knows, one can almost get a BOGO deal off it. Going to the Wendy's locations in my area, I have had it honored with promotional sandwiches as well as regular sandwiches. The only problem is that different locations have their versions of what a customer, like myself, can actually buy.

When I get a coupon in the mail where it states that you can only get a chicken sandwich (Homestyle, Grilled, Spicy) with purchase of another.  it is what it is because it blatantly says it. 

The receipt deal states ""Get a Free Dave's Single or Chicken Sandwich (does not disclose what kind of Chicken sandwich) with the purchase of ANY premium sandwich. So that means anything premium. Well, if you look at premium, it is defined as any sandwich not a value or on the value menu. So any sandwich, even promotional, should be up for grabs. 

In KY, I have had one location (Thunderstick Dr.) tell me that I could not get a spicy chicken sandwich, it had to be Homestyle if I am buying a premium. Sometimes, I would be able to get a promotional sandwich like a S'awesome burger, Peppercorn Mushroom melt, and even a Barbecue Cheeseburger and then get a value item like a Homestyle, as the free and they restrict it to that (but the receipt does not disclose what kind of chicken sandwich...read it). 

At the location I went to tonight, on Richmond Rd., I was told that the new promotional chicken sandwiches like the S'awesome Bacon Chicken, Avocado BLT, and Barbecue Chicken were NOT premium. So what are they considered? 

This is why there needs to be a training because when I see ""ANY premium chicken sandwich, for completing a survey,"" it literally means ANY. 

Until this is figured out, people could essentially be misled and they could have received something they may have had to settle for over a sandwich they actually wanted. So all this survey taking for better customer service goes out the window because receiving an unwanted sandwich IS bad customer service. What is worse is that the sandwich settled for is dictated by the franchise, not corporate. The receipt offers are from corporate right? Because we have to complete the surveys? Why are franchises allowed to dictate the meaning of what sandwich a customer should get?",-0.058766233766233765,Negative
730,Wendy's,1.0,"If only I had been knowledgeable about the internet when my ""experience"" happened at this location some years ago, I could've gotten this out sooner...

I'd like to share with everyone an old story from this location that happened some time in the summer of 2006 or 2007. Me and my cousin were frequent visitors to this restaurant. We ate inside most of the time to enjoy the peace and quiet and often chit-chat with a few of the employees when the impending rush was at a minimum. My family and I ate there for nearly 6 years. The burgers were decent; Spicy Chicken Sandwich gets a 21-gun salute! Never been disappointed with that choice of sandwich. The last time I visited here, me and my cousin ate in. We were awaiting the arrival of the public transportation (M.A.R.T.A). We had some junior bacon cheese burgers and some small sodas. Nothing too heavy, just to hit the spot before we went on our way. Before we planned to depart, my cousin attempted to get another refill after he had already had maybe, 2 or 3 refills when the female manager at the time, refused to do so. I witness this from the dining section, and I'm upset along with him as well. I even went so far as to call the 1-800 number that was on the cup I purchased to verify if this type of treatment was justifiable - basically, to see if she was living up to the policy itself. From what I was told previously in the past: Wendy's customers that dine in (as we did), are allowed unlimited refills, but the thing is: they don't use the same cup your mouth was around, and have to use a whole new cup. Regardless, that female manager violated Wendy's policy on serving paying customers that were dining in! But there's more to this story...

From me and my cousin's observation, we've witnessed customers on ""the lighter skin side of life"", getting far better treatment than us, regular customers. By that, ""those"" people got greeted upon entering, and farewells while leaving. There were times we entered after ""they"" entered, and could hear while the door was opened ""Hi! Welcome to Wendy's!"" but as we entered, silence and glares.

So now you can get a gist of the atmosphere my cousin and I stirred up just by alone, being on the property, even though we never caused absolutely any trouble. Back on track...

   On behalf of my cousin, I went to speak on the matter to the same lady at the counter to tell her she could not do that. She doesn't answer anything I'm saying, just looks at me in disgust and resumes what she's doing. She never asks me to leave, but suddenly a police offer enters the store, and right away, she signals to him that I'm being ""an issue."" He tells me to leave, I try to explain to him for some unknown reason thinking he would be a voice of reason (this would be the last day I have faith in anyone who wore a badge). With an attitude, I proceeded to leave, but had to get my umbrella where my cousin was, the officer then grabs me from behind and delivers the hand of justice to me by forcibly removing me - mind you, those four people in the dining area said that wasn't necessary - I get thrown on the ground, and arrested for Disorderly Conduct. My cousin is patted down outside the store, but only I get arrested.

Restaurants like these with biased mentalities towards customers that aren't ""on the lighter side of life"" need to be reevaluated. I have not returned there since then. Can you blame me? I attempted to reach Wendy's Corporate Office after my ""detention"" was over, but I had no success.

This steam lines the process and keeps things going. 

I can't complain about the food since is is exactly the same as every other Wendy's I have been to. Often they don't include tomatoes on my chicken sandwiches, which is fine by me since I pick them off anyway, but it's weird that they are their half the time and half the time they are not.",-0.08730158730158728,Negative

Also, there was a person in front of us in line, and somehow the employee told us to wait for a ""moment"" which turn into 12 minutes waiting for her to take our order!

Unfortunately, tonight's situation given to us about 30mins ago is absolutely wrong on a whole other level.

Me: ""I have 3 orders but they are...""
- cuts me off -
Drive Through Worker: ""Nope... you have to come in to order that.""
Me: ""Are you serious?""
Drive Through Worker: ""yep.""

No explanation, no apologies.

So I walk in and wait 10 minutes in line.
I place my order and ask why I couldn't place the order in the drive through.
The lady taking my order said she 'thinks it's because the drive through gets backed up and it helps it go faster, so they don't allow anyone with more than 2 orders to order from there...""

After telling her that I was the only person in the line... I ask ""what if I just started saying my order and NOT disclose that I had 3 orders to place...?""

She says that I probably would have gone through.

I laughed. So comical. There was not even a CLEAR reason for this. Just an assumption.

I took a walk through the restaurant to find any posting of who the management was. Any customer comment cards. ANYTHING to provide feedback. 
This may be a slow and rude Wendy's but they aren't dumb. They definitely don't give access to those types of feedback because they know they will be inundated with comments.

I know fast food places tend to have a lot of mistakes, but so far to date, I dont recall have any issues. I generally order from the dollar-ish menu and order as is, so its fair to say that I keep that part of it easy for them. Sometimes I grab a regular combo from the menu or try something new that they are offering. I do miss the crispy dill chicken sandwich they put out at one time. The interior (and exterior) is really nice, they have a comfortable setting since they have gotten away from the older style restaurants and went more modern. From a nostalgic perspective, I do kind of miss the older style decor they had as I remember in the 90's.   I do enjoy the latest development with the soda machine, where you can select a wide variety of options and flavors. 

I gave them an extra star because Wendy's has really been putting out different options here recently, trying to spruce up the menu a bit.

No one knows what's on the menu, how to take an order ... much less how to make a sandwich. I would be amazed if I ever got out of there without having to ask for something again (like today, they gave me my food and said thank you ... but I had to say ""you never gave me my drink."" and they looked confused and made me one).

One time one of my friends went to pick up food for a bunch of us ... when an hour went by (this Wendy's is five minutes from my house), my other friend says ""Where are they?"" to which I simply responded, ""They're probably having issues or something."" Living up to my expectation, my friend arrived just after that with a look of anger and disgust on his face. How hard is it to make a sandwich withOUT something on it? What is hard about NO MAYO or NO TOMATO? They just can't get it.

Another thing ... don't even think about dining in. The dining room is always filthy even when they are SLOOOOOOOOOOW. Why is no one keeping it up? Every single table is dirty and the trash is one the floor. Makes no sense.

I normally hit this Wendy's during the late night hours, cause the drive thru is open to 3am.  However, the one thing I have to stress is check your food when u get it.

The last three times I've gone, I've had to go back because I didnt check my food and got home to discover that it was wrong, and when you pay almost $8 for chicken sandwich, I expect it to be right!

I've had missing bacon, globs of mayo spreaded on the sandwich after requesting light mayo, and a tomato that was so green it should have been put in some cornmeal and served as a fried green tomato instead of a sandwich tomato.

Never ever been inside this location so I cant speak on the cleaniness of the place, but the drive thur is normally quick to get thru.

I won't really think about how it was happening while I was sitting eating, I just like that attention to detail.  And the manager was friendly as all get out, holy cow.  Stood talking to this one guy who kept him engaged, not about anything in particular, but just b/c that guy wanted to talk.

And of course the food is super quick.  Okay, so maybe they left the sauce on both my chicken sandwich and the hubs' burger when we requested dry.  Secretly I really did want the sauce on mine, and they quickly exchanged that 99 cent bacon cheeseburger for one with no sauce -- not just scraped off, but a whole new one.

808,Wendy's,1.0,"This is literally the worst Wendy's I have ever been too. First issue, it was dirty!!!! Second issue, the young lady at the front counter couldn't speak up to save her life. Literally if there was a fire she would be the one that you wouldn't want to alert anyone about it; because no one would hear her say fire. I had to repeatedly ask her, what? Over and over and then lean across the counter to try and hear her and then still couldn't hear her. It was a nightmare to order and pay for the meal because of it. 

Third issue, the young man handing out food also couldn't speak up. I had to call out the name he was ""yelling"" out because no one could hear him either. 

Fourth issue, no soda on multiple kinds. I asked for them to fill the Dr Pepper and instead of filling it up they filled it behind counter (that I'm thankful for) but then when we go to refill, we have to ask them to do it again behind counter because they still hadn't replaced it in dining room machine. The second machine wasn't even operating. 

Fifth issue, no small cup lids and no fire in their pants to even fill them up. Our group alone had 10 people that needed that size lid and after an hour of being there they still didn't fill them. That's not including the other customers in there that had to ask for lids also. The manager or someone should have taken a min to fix these minor dining room issues; unless the manager didn't order correctly and they didn't have any to replace. Either way I saw no effort in attempting to even reconcile the issues. 

Sixth issue, the tables were gross and I had to wash my own table/seats down before we could sit. Every single table was nasty  the floor was gross, the trash cans overfilled. Just horrible. 

Seventh issue, one of our orders was a regular grilled chicken sandwich (the only order on this particular ticket) and they gave us some avocado bacon chicken sandwich. We had to have it redone and then wait and wait for it to be done. I believe it should have been pushed to the front of the cue line. 

Eighth issue, our fries were old and over cooked at that. Didn't eat them all. But you have a choice, have them give you new ones and wait even longer for it, eat them or throw them away. I chose throw them away. Not worth it for the other two options. 

Last issue, number nine, they only had 5 people working on a sat afternoon. You can not schedule only 5 people to work on a weekend day. This is most likely why this location is the way it is. 

Only good thing I'll say about it is the women's bathroom was okay. It wasn't dirty and didn't smell at all. So that's literally the only plus I could give it.",-0.1036999458874459,Negative

Ordered a chicken sandwich. It arrived cold and the tiny chicken patty was burned.

Asked for the change back between the cost of the two items (it wasn't offered to me). Manager had to approve it and open the till.

It was hot and fresh but a little too much mayo was on it.  However, that's not really a problem.  We had napkins.  My only complaint was really the lettuce.

3 starts for my one point of caution - I have run across several incidences where the posted price is lower than what they actually charge you.  And even after pointing it out, it will still be the same discrepancy at a later visit.  Second, they will ""upsell"" your meal size, even when you don't ask for it.

831,Wendy's,4.0,"Howell Mill Wendy's is my neighborhood Wendy's.  I've been coming to this Wendy's since I was a college student at Georgia Tech.  In those days, the 99¢ value menu existed.  These days, it's the ""Right Price Right Size Value Menu,"" a menu Wendy's has been rolling out to its restaurants nationwide in 2013.  While I'm disappointed, I can't blame them.  Costs increase.  Less than half of the original 99¢ menu items are still available for 99¢.  Examples of items I typically order that used to be 99¢:

Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger - now $1.59
Double Stack - now $1.79
Caesar or Garden Side Salad - now $1.39
Small Chili - now $1.49

Regardless of the price increases, the value menu is still dirt cheap.  You can stuff yourself silly for just about $5.00 with a meal that includes vegetables, carbs, protein, and a sweet dessert.  Plus, 99¢ items still exist, such as the Jr. Cheeseburger, Crispy Chicken Sandwich, 4-piece Chicken Nuggets, and a ""Value"" sized Natural-Cut Fries, soft drink, and Frosty.

When it comes to fast food, I prefer Chick-fil-A and McDonald's because, to me, they taste better.  Wendy's isn't far behind, though.  They've stepped their game up in the French fry department.  I also think their nuggets and side salads (using mixed greens) are underrated.  I like that you can get their nuggets spicy.

Also, I love the Vanilla Frosty.  So much better than the chocolate, IMO.

This Wendy's location underwent a renovation within the past few years, so it has a relatively fresh and updated look.

None of us had felt like eating much during the heat of the day; and, during the rain, so we decided to go through the drive-thru at Wendy's on the way home.  I saw the new Bacon Queso; and, saw that Chicken was a viable option, so that's what I ordered.  What I got, however, was a darn good tasting burger; but, it wasn't what I had ordered.  My daughter did better with her Home Style Chicken Sandwich; and, her friends 6-Piece Chicken Nugget meal was fine.  The frosty I got was so frozen, it was impossible to drink until much later (we stopped in the parking lot to eat.)  I don't usually go through the drive-thru and now I remember why!  The two cars in front of us EACH had to casually peruse every item on the menu before making a decision; and, ""Umed, Ohed and Aahed"" with every decision.

I'm not a fan of fast food, but my little boy wanted Wendy's and this one was the closest one to where we are located.  I went with my wife, my oldest and youngest son's and I think that will easily be the worst spent $39 (yes, you read that right!) all year.  I'm like fully convinced that at the end of this year, I'll still rank it this way.

So, you may be asking yourself what in the world did I spend $39 on?  Well, $39 for 3 Baconator meals, chicken sandwiches for my son with a side of fries and Baconator fries.  With that being said, I wish I can rank zero stars due to their extremely poor customer service, non-working soda machines, non-working ice machines, Baconator fries with shredded cheese and pieces of bacon cold with each order smaller than the next.  

It took 15 minutes to get my food and I had to bring it back because of the cheap cop out serving of fries.  I went to their drink machine and it wasn't working, their ice machine wasn't working and a meal now costs $9 each!  To make things worst, the building is half-empty, are just as expensive as their neighbors Chick-fil-A and their service was completely awful.  

I will never step foot at this Wendy's and quite frankly, you shouldn't either.

864,Wendy's,1.0,"I'm not one to be picky.  I give establishments  3 chances to see if they can fulfill my demands, so that I can continue supporting them.  My recent visit to this Wendy's, in particular, really made me mad.

My first bad experience consisted of a Baconator burger that was too crispy.  It barely had any flavor or juicy sensation.  The fries were also very crispy and not soft enough.  The fruit punch beverage tasted like water too.  The employee that I brought this up to said there was nothing he could do about it.  5 minutes later, another employee came by the beverage dispensers and changed out the beverages that tasted bad.  Wait what?  You couldn't do anything, you said??

My second bad experience consisted of an employee that asked if I wanted a receipt for frosties that I ordered.  I denied.  And just as she went to get the frosties I ordered, I politely told her I changed my mind that I did want a receipt after all.   She begrudgingly printed out a copy of my order and looked at me with an impatient rage.  There was no one else in the restaurant!  Not like she had anyone else to take care of.

And finally: the thing that really turned me away was a piece of hair, I discovered as I ate half way through my spicy chicken sandwich.  Disgusting!  And that's not all.  What possibly looked to be the same employee who served me the second time, served me my sandwich via drive-thru, with negativity in her face being visibly open like she hates her job.

The double single cheeseburger is okay but I'd pass on the single as it's too much bun in relation to the patty.

Great thing with Wendy's is you can pick any side with your combo without paying extra. Caesar salads have been consistently fresh and generously sized. Their Nacho Chili cheese is surprisingly tasty.

Unlimited refills on their drinks with the Coca-Cola Self-Serve touchscreen machines you see find in the movie theatres with several flavours!

The 4 for $4 is a pretty good deal, plenty of food for a lunch.  The spicy nuggets were very processed, slightly spicy, and a very small portion.  Decent fries, decent bacon cheeseburger.  The cod sandwich was pretty good- a thick portion of nicely-fried cod.  The asiago chicken was ""good not great""- plasticky pink tomato, meh lettuce, okay chicken, way too much mayo.

But this particular location has problems.
Almost every time you go there, they make a mistake.

They will forget an item, or charge you for an additional item (which, of course, you don't end up noticing until they bring out your food, unless you check your receipt while waiting), and god forbid you have a ""special order"" (add pickles, no mayo, whatever), there is a fair chance, that they will mess that up. If you ask for something to be added, there is a 50/50 shot they will forget to add it.
If you ask for a sandwich without a certain item, there is a 50/50 shot, that they will leave that item in. And if they remember to not include that particular item, there is a good chance they will also not include other parts of the sandwich that you did want. (eg. I went there on Friday, ordered the sriracha chicken sandwich with no onions, they gave it to me with nothing but chicken and creamy sriracha. When I brought it back to have it fixed, they forgot the cheese).

I noticed that during peak hours, they have 2-3 staff members taking orders outside to speed things up.

This recently rebuilt store is a bit more spacious and the drive-thru​ lane was redesigned to improve traffic flow. 

Service here is nothing but exceptional. Customer satisfaction is always a priority. 

We've ordered lots of chicken sandwiches, chicken biscuits and chick-n-minis from here. Most orders were done correctly. Slip-ups​ are bound to happen when there's a restaurant as busy as this. And they've always corrected the order for us.

Got home and enjoyed breakfast and about an hour after consuming the egg white chicken sandwich, I experienced horrible stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting, all at the same time.

They ask you what kind of sauce you want, and you definitely can't go wrong with the Chick-fil-A sauce.  It goes well with both the chicken and the fries.

The first time they missed the fries, but, hey, it happens sometimes -- no big deal. The second time I ordered a spicy deluxe sandwich with bacon, only to come home and see that they gave me a plain grilled chicken sandwich. Pretty frustrating, but, okay, at least it's forcing me to be healthy. 


This leads to today when, again, I pay for the Grilled Chicken Entree only to come home and see two soggy pieces of fried fish, tossed on top of two pickles, sandwiched between the buns. My friends kept telling me not to order from here, yet here we are. There are plenty of other restaurants that are significantly more reliable (and better) than this particular Chick-fil-A. Zaxby's, Mary Mac's Tea Room, Hattie B's, KFC, are all better maintained than this location. Hell, there are like 3 other Chick-fil-As in the area -- just do a quick google maps search.

There is no service like Chick-fil-A service. I don't know if it's because of the Godly nature of this institution, but it has made me a better fast food purchaser. 

Now, we all know what CFA has to offer. Delicious chicken sandwiches, waffle fries, milkshakes, breakfast-to-die-for. Diet lemonade. Chick-fil-A is a poor man's crack as well as food for the masses (of prep-school students, moms, and believers). 

With this being said, I have to tell a sad yet compelling story to you all.
It was a Saturday morning, say 8 AM. The night preceding my breakfast meal at Chick-fil-A was debaucherous. Which is not a word according to spell-check, apparently. 

I rolled up to this Chick fil A relatively hung-over. I was wearing my pathetic glasses that are missing an ear-stem. Crooked and looking haggard, you can't deny that I was obviously covered in glitter. If you were to look closely, the only thing in my passenger seat would have been a wig. So I glittered over to the cashier and handed him my card. Which embarrassingly declined.  

The teen-aged boy working the register was obviously holding back laughter, but was completely sincere that I could take my breakfast- no. big. deal. I kept repeating ""Are you SURE?"". 

He was sure. God bless yall.",0.052777777777777764,Positive

You will never wait for too long for your spicy chicken sandwich fix (that's one of my menu favorites) at this Chick-fil-A. Even in the most chaotic lunchtime rush, the staff members are always friendly. I have used their online catering menu to place orders for meetings at my office, and this is always so easy.

903,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"Chick-fil-A is getting five stars from me partially because they are a sentimental favorite, but also because I go here so much they know me on sight.  The manager gave me a highfive through the drive-thru window the other day.  One of the employees refers to me as ""Sweet Tea"" since that's what I always get.

So yes.  It probably only deserves four but it gets the fifth because I love it that much.

Onto the food: The new spicy chicken sandwich is a thing of beauty, and way better than the competitor spicy chickens around.  It's just the right blend of hot without being overwhelming and it benefits from being eaten plain, or just with mayo.  For some reason the cheese, lettuce and tomato only serve to mess with the flavor.

However, it's not really the lunch here that won over my heart, it was the breakfast.  Chick-fil-A has hands down the best breakfast food of any fast food chain.  The chicken biscuit is flaky and salty and sweet (if you add honey like I do) all at the same time and it's perfect.  The chicken minis come on teeny tiny rolls that are fluffy cushions of buttery goodness.  The tater tots are about the size of a three nickels stacked on top of each other and the perfect accompaniment  to the rest of your meal.  

If you go for breakfast give yourself a good ten minute cushion because they are incredibly strict about the 10:30 rule.  At 10:31, there will be no biscuit for you!",0.22714045214045214,Positive

908,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"Chick-Fil-A is really the best of the best in regards to fast food chains.  I really admire a company that puts their principles into action over profits (remaining closed on Sundays) and I really don't care what others think of it.  With that being said Chick-Fil-A couldn't stay in business without having the best chicken in the business and there's no doubt here that when it comes to chicken you're not going to find any fast food chains with better chicken.  

Yes Popeyes! chicken is totally awesome but it's also a totally different style of chicken than Chick-Fil-A.  I think the only food that could challenge them is Raising Cane's chicken.  Not only is this restaurant clean and brightly lit, with very friendly people but you will also find the place really a great place to take children as they have a huge area for them to play in.  

I typically get a spicy chicken sandwich and a side of chicken noodle soup (which is delicious) but their wraps, especially the grilled chicken wrap is great if I'm in the mood to eat a little healthier.  At many fast food restaurants the ""healthy"" food is something you suffer through when you're watching your waistline but not the wraps here, I'd order them just because they are that good.  

Their fries are really good *IF* they are just fresh made but I find once they get to room temperature they really are pretty average.  So make sure that if you get fries you get them hot and eat them while they're hot!

The chicken sandwiches are all excellent and you can order them plain (just chicken) or deluxe with lettuce and tomato; and you can get ready or spicy.  My favorite is the spicy chicken deluxe.  And don't forget the waffle fries.  I'm somewhat of a fry freak and I love their waffle fries.  Their lemonade is also excellent.

The food was fresh and good for a fast food restaurant. I had the spicy chicken sandwich. I was served hot, but it was not at all spicy. Although, I would still order it over the regular chicken sandwich. The employees were friendly and efficient. Just remember to ask for ketchup when you order because they don't leave any out.",0.14583333333333331,Positive
913,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"I think fast-food workers sometimes are unfairly maligned for their supposed surliness.  In my experience, probably 80-90% of them at least say ""sir"" and ""thank you"" and ""have a good day,"" if not with a smile, than at least in a friendly fashion.  

But Chick-fil-a takes it a step further.  I don't know if they train the employees to be super-polite, or if they just tend to hire friendly people, but it shows.  I really like how they say ""my pleasure"" instead of ""you're welcome.""  It lends a bit of Southern class to the transaction.  As far as service goes, is there another fast-food place that hires a worker specifically to take people's trays and offer refills?  I doubt it.

All of that would be moot if the food wasn't good, but it's perfect.  How they get the chicken to be so juicy and flavorful, I don't know, but it puts all other fast-food chicken sandwiches to shame (including McDonald's ""Southern-style"" sandwich, a pathetic attempt at a ripoff).  I get the regular breaded sandwich with extra pickles and dip it in buffalo sauce, and there are very few foods I'd rather eat, especially in the realm of fast food.  The waffle fries, too, are among the best fries available, with tons of potato flavor, and the shape is perfect for scooping up copious quantities of ketchup.  Chick-fil-a serves some of the best lemonade in town as well.

I did try the new spicy sandwich a couple of months ago, and while it was delicious, it left me in intestinal agony for a good 36 hours.  But my stomach is growing more and more sensitive to spicy foods as I get older, so that's just me... hopefully your experience will be better.

If I had to find something to complain about, it's that they offer ketchup only by the packet.  If you use as much ketchup as I do on your fries, every meal here will begin with three or four minutes of opening and squeezing. 

I can't really complain about them being closed on Sundays, because I understand why they do it and it's very admirable.  It just seems like every time I get a strong craving for Chick-fil-a, it's Sunday.",0.24613237639553426,Positive

It was hot enough and was from the breast.  But where I have a problem is with the tomato.  There were two slivers of tomato on mine, maybe one sixteenth of an inch thick and less than the size of the bun if you put both of them side-by-side.

New restaurants are constantly popping up all over the Columbus area. There are also many places that have been here for a long time but seem to take that for granted, but not Chick-fil-A!

Chick-fil-A started in 1946 as the Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, Georgia.  In 1961 the name was changed to Chick-fil-A.  The first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta, GA.

Every Chick-fil-A that I have ever been to treats the customers with care, and truly appreciates that you are eating at their restaurant.  This location goes above and beyond to make sure that you have a fantastic experience.  

I eat out a lot and find that most places seem to care but not really.  Today I had the best experience ever and I wanted to share it with everybody.

We arrived a few minutes before noon on Tuesday April 2, 2019.  The line for the drive thru was wrapped around the building, which is normal for this location.  The parking lot was nearly full, but we found a place to park.  As we entered the building a worker was wiping the windows down and greeted us with a genuine hello and a smile.  The line to place an order was 3 rows deep which seems like it would take forever to get through the line, but they have about 5 registers open and the line moves really fast.

Our order taker was friendly, cheerful and seemed to really care about being there and helping us with our order.  He answered all of our questions and was very helpful with taking our order.  The order process was flawless!  I appreciated that they weren't stingy with the dipping sauces and let us choose several different kinds.

We headed toward the dining room to find a table and and as we were sitting down two employees came over to assist.

One brought over a high chair and removed the regular chair and the the other rolled out the red carpet for us.  She put a disposable placement down along with Purell wipes for the little one and then she brought us napkins, plastic ware, and ketchup.

We were totally impressed with the level of service today.

We didn't even have to go back up for drink refills as somebody came by later to refill our drinks and get a to-go back for some leftovers.

929,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"What can I say about Chick-fil-A? I think the fact that every time I go to a Chick-fil-A the drive-through is full. That shows that it is a very popular place to eat. Most the time I go inside to place my order because it's not as full inside as it is outside in the drive-through line. But this place consistently delivers good fresh quality food. Their chicken sandwiches are delicious.  Their waffle fries are unique and delicious.  The chicken nuggets can be ordered breaded or grilled and they are real chicken. It is a great place to bring the kids and let them play in the little children's playground side of each restaurant. And the servers and cashiers there are always super friendly and seem to be genuinely happy to be working there. I have been to several Chick-fil-A's around central and western Florida and they are always consistent. The fact that they're closed on Sunday is a very courageous act, but one that I wish more of us would follow. They take seriously that Sunday is a day of worship and family time. What a wonderful world we would live in if we could get back to that way of life.",0.23072552447552444,Positive
930,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"This is a solid Chick-fil-A! It's in a convenient location, and the employees are friendly. The drive-thru does take a fairly long time. However, I've found this to be the case at most Chick-fil-A's. The inside line also takes a while. Even so, the space is clean and the food is above average quality for a fast food joint. 

You also get a free chocolate chip cookie if you check-in on Yelp! I had never ordered a cookie from a Chick-fil-A before and I was very pleasantly surprised. It was large and tasty. I also enjoy the Spicy chicken sandwich and the grilled chicken nuggets. The nuggets are low calorie and high in protein, so I consider the nuggets an almost healthy snack option. 

Also, the lemonade here, like at all other Chick-fil-A's, is delicious. However, I noticed a tendency to put too much ice in the lemonades. I order the lemonade with ""no ice"" and I end up getting a ton more. The lemonade is still cold, too. 

Overall, this is a solid place for a snack. I recommend and will return when I'm in the mood for some lemonade.",0.1274642857142857,Positive

We went and the manager that had a sleeve on her right arm, tan with black hair said absolutely not. I didn't get her name but I did see manager on her badge. She looked at him as if he was lying. The another manager on duty said that sounds ridiculous, wow okay, very nice. She had the stripe uniform, and blonde hair. They mistreat the customers. I thought the customers always right logo.

934,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"Chick-fil-A is an all around great fast food chain, and definitely my go-to for a sandwich and fries. They have crispy fried chicken sandwiches and nuggets. They also have grilled chicken sandwiches and grilled nuggets which have fewer carbs and calories. The best side is of course the waffle fries, they're always crisp and hot, with the perfect amount of sea salt. They also have fruit and a kale ""superfood"" side as well. Just be careful as the ""superfood"" side unfortunately has a good amount of sugar due to the dressing.

In addition to sandwiches and fries Chick-fil-A has fantastic salads. They could beef up the fresh toppings a bit but the lettuce is always fresh and they have a nice assortment of dressings. They also have breakfast and dessert. I love their frozen coffee, it's the perfect combination of a sugar fix and a pick me up.

This Chick-fil-A in particular is just as good as all the others. For quite some time they struggled to efficiently handle the large crowds that gather for lunch every day. They've recently instituted the best practices followed by other Chick-fil-A's including attendant led ordering in the drive thru and crowd control in the dining room. These have helped quite lot. The employees here are as friendly as any of the Chick-fil-A's I've been to. 

For quite some time they've had a special check in offer on yelp - a free Chocolate Chunk Cookie! Hello! These cookies are actually really hearty and good, soft, with large chunks of chocolate. I would say they're far better than what I would expect from a fast food restaurant. If that's not enough to get you to come in I don't know what is. Bonus - I've used the check in offer more than once. ;-)

I would recommend downloading the Chick-fil-A One app because they often give away freebies in the app, no purchases necessary. The calendar card that is sold once a year around the holidays is also a great value and a good gift idea. It's 12 months worth of free items, one for each month, and typically costs about $7.00. So for the price of a meal you get 12 free things.

It's great to have a Chick-fil-A on the South side of downtown, and this one has definitely improved over time.",0.32301587301587303,Positive
935,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"As fast food goes, Chick-fil-A is far and away my favorite.  No one can touch their incredible chicken sandwich with its buttery bun and secret recipe chicken breast.  This S Orange location is very busy, but they do a good job keeping the drive thru moving efficiently, especially during the busiest times of the day.  Being as busy as they are sometimes traffic can wrap around the building, so they have implemented a cone system and have employees standing outside with tablets to take your order and allow you to pay right there with a card or your phone app.  This allows the staff inside to just handle delivering the food to you when you get to the window.  No system is perfect, but I still gave them 5 stars for quality of food, overall efficiency, value, and friendliness.  The new app, Chick-fil-A ONE, is one more benefit since you can register your calendar card (for free food), and you can earn more ""treats"" by using the app.  You can even order ahead and wait for the food in a designated parking space and someone will bring it out to you.

My chicken sandwich was hot and steamy and the waffle fries were hot with just the right amount of crispness. Here is what I witnessed that WAS different from most any other fast food chain. They were VERY busy and had four registers running with 10 people deep in each line. It took some time until I reached the front of the line to order but the team work I witnessed behind the counter was outstanding. The employees hustled about in perfect harmony, they greeted each customer with a smile, and thanked me after I was given my order.

You see, these restaurants don't exist in my state (Washington) anymore, and I only ever hear about them from others who are lucky enough to live in an area served by these restaurants. Well, then there's also the CEO comment thing, but this review's not here to talk about that. The food here is okay, though by no means exceptional. You can get a chicken sandwich served to you at the airport here. That's about all there is to this place. That doesn't necessarily speak for all the other Chick-fil-A locations that I didn't visit, but this review isn't about them either.

To start with, this place is pretty overpriced for fast food. I got a deluxe sandwich, a fruit cup, and an iced tea totaling more than ten dollars. It's a bit unreasonable. And the sandwich itself is really nothing special; it just consists of chicken, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. The fruit cup had sliced strawberries, apples, oranges, and grapes that were probably kept in a refrigerator for a while and weren't fresh. And the large cup of iced tea was just that; there's no reason it should have cost $1.79! If the food were a little better and the prices were lower, then I might like this place more.

Also, it's actually a healthier choice over the normal burger and fries as the grilled chicken sandwich has only 4 grams of fat and 29 grams of protein! (just looked it up on their website)

I've long heard stories from friends and coworkers originally from the South about the famed Chick-fil-A sandwich. I found myself in MCO a week ago and there it was like a beacon in the center of the food court!

I ordered two sandwiches and loved their simplicity. Much better than other fast food chicken sandwiches, most definitely and certainly more authentic looking and tasting (no preformed mechanically-separated chicken patty here!).

I'll admit that the highlight of the meal was the addition of their buffalo sauce to the sandwich. Added a perfect spicy and buttery kick. If they bottled this stuff, I'd put it on everything.

The spicy chicken sandwich tasted like it had been made way in advance and just kept warm, it was also super salty. Waffle-cut fries were okay but barely warm.

At 1:30 in the afternoon my daughter and I chose to wait in a very long line with the mindset that at least our food would be hot (wrong). There were 4 cashiers working so we thought that possibly the line would move quickly and orders would be correct (wrong). When I received my chicken sandwich the bun was so hard I had to throw away the bottom half because it was literally inedible. I was actually glad I removed the bun because it gave me a chance to examine the rest of the sandwich... the lettuce was so brown it was almost black, I had to look twice to make sure I didn't see any slime. The tomatoes were not ripe at all - they were mostly yellow. And the cheese was so hard and stuck to the other bun I had to peel it off. The only thing that was good was the chicken itself. I basically ate the chicken and the pickle. The waffle fries were surprisingly cold - I was surprised at this due to the speed at which the food was coming out. The customer service was great and our cashier was friendly, accurate, and she handled herself well with a line that would've stressed out the Pope.

My grilled chicken sandwich got odd when it got crunchy chewy.  I opened it up and I had two tomato slices that were far from ripe and whoever made the sandwich put two tomato ends on it.  Not one...but yes two!The dark green center rhine was all there.  I got two ends of unripe tomatoes with green leafy centers.  WTH!   I just took the tomatoes off and cut out the 3/4 inch centers and put them back on.  I wasn't going to say anything but as I was leaving I requested a refill on my drink and was asked ""How was everything tonight?""  I hesitated on my response but then felt obligated to explain my hesitation.  I told her about the dark green center unripe tomatoes (2) that someone put on my sandwich.  Her response was "" OK I'll let them know about that"" and she walk three feet back to register after handing me the refill and took the next customer's order.

The Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich- what a signature sandwich to get inducted into the family for the first time.  It was beautifully crisped, and lightly buttered on top.  It came with lett, and tom, and had just the right amount of kick.  Yelp! Tip- the Sandwiches DO NOT come with dressing for the most part.  Request the Chick-Fil-A sauce for the REG GRILLED/FRIED sandwiches.

The Chick-Fil-A Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich- this is definitely my go to sandwich for grilled chicken.  I love the signature honey roasted bbq sauce, but still not my favorite sauce overall.  The lemon grilled chicken here is so juicy, it's incredible that its fast food.  This sandwich is a BONUS for the Apple-wood smoked bacon--that was the REAL stuff, cause no-one likes a faker.  The brioche bun was the BEST to hold the entire sandwich together.

WAFFLE POTATO FRIES- this is my winner for BEST side you can get at a ""fast food"" establishment.  Their perfectly crispy while still maintaining those squishy parts, like a good bum bum.  Always hard to order a large cause they sell out FAST.  Get these with the Sweet N Spicy Sriracha Sauce- THE BEST SAUCE HERE.  This sauce I will actually replace on ALL my sandwiches from now on, a delicious blend of chili peppers for a spicy twist. Unfortunately, it's one of the only sauces you can't get in bulk.  Get the POLYNESIAN SAUCE in the bulk bottle, the CHICK-FIL-A sauce goes bad FAST in bulk bottle.

BEVERAGE- i am making a note that my Dr. Pepper tasted so real, that the regular beverages are still ABOVE most fast food establishments.

During lunch, there are over 10 people standing at car windows taking orders so it was ready to go when you got to the window.

I'm not sure what my favorite quick item to pick up here, the chicken sandwich, so basic but delicious with pickles and a buttered bun or the fresh squeezed, sweet as can be lemonade (diet & regular), waffles fries, the dipping sauces or the chicken biscuit minis for breakfast. 

Literally, took less than 10 minutes to get through an 8 car drive-thru line with 5 orders for coworkers and none were messed up - even the sauces were all in the correct bags!

My boyfriend ordered the Spicy Deluxe Chicken for us. Everything was tasty. The chicken was seasoned so well and it was cooked perfectly. The tomato, lettuce, pickle and pepper jack cheese definitely made this one hell of a chicken sandwich!

This Chik-Fil-A has a drive thru and walk up windows. All employees were over the top friendly and continuously asked us how we were doing and if there was anything we needed.

I love the chicken minis, and would order them over and over again because they were delicious. However, the regular chicken sandwich was kind of boring and I don't think I would order it again unless I added more toppings. My husband loved the spicy chicken sandwhich and wished we had more Chick-Fil-A's in Michigan. The staff were beyond friendly, they were outside in the rain, taking customer's orders.

Chick Fil A has amazing consistency through all their stores. Each store I go to has amazing service. Culvers is the only other brand that I can find that has the same level of service. The people working there prob make 8-9 bucks an hour and typically for lower paying jobs, you don't find much service. But Chick Fil A manages to find good employees. In any case, service here is always good. They have very efficient lunch time service with staff that come out and take your order and deliver to your car.

1018,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"Please be warned that this review is 40% about the restaurant and 60% of the corporation, concept and founder of Chick Fil-A. 

I had never eaten at a Chick Fil-A before 3 months ago.   (Hey, I'm from California.)  I was browsing at Half-priced books and saw the autobiography of Truett Cathy (Founder of the enterprise) in the bargain bin and I picked it up, knowing only that it was a succesful business and his picture seemed quite likable.   I vaguely recalled there was a Christian angle and despite being fairly ferociously anti-organized religion and particularly anti- Southern-Baptist-Conservative-hatemonger-Republican-crook and scallywag machine, I was still interested.   I like a good rags to riches story.  I was open-minded.  

This sounds dorky, but, seriously I could not put the freakin' book down.  Truett Cathey is a marvelous human being.    He is all about charity and good works, and happy people and feeding the hungry and helping poor orphans and ohmygawd, I was impressed.   This is a REALLY GOOD man.   (not at all like the christians we hear about, if you know what i mean).   When he talks about god, its with a pure joy and celebration -- y'know -- the whole ""god is love thing"".   The whole vengeful nasty racist homophobic god is nowhere in sight.  

Anyway, this guy has a tremendous rags to riches story that might just leave you teary at times.  I was inspired.  If you know anything about how franchises typically work, this one will blow you away because the business model is NOTHING like any other franchise.  Actually, its not technically a franchise. 

Now to the food.  OK, I'm inspired by the book so I have to try a sandwich.   I did.  Its a chicken sandwich.  It didn't dance and sing.   Its was pretty good for fast food and I did like the diet lemonade.  I had a salad later on that was bland but decent.    The people who work at Chick Fil A  are freakishly nice and friendly.   If you read the book, it all makes sense.   Is it going to make me run out and give up my heathen multitheastic ways?  No.  But it does give me hope that there are really truly good people in this world who are inspiring.

oh...and I found out later....he is a friend of Jimmy Carter's, while one source said that he was a lifelong Dem, I found out quite the contrary:


The founder of this restaurant does contribute seemingly exclusively to Republicans.  I was very very disappointed to see that he had supported McCain in the last presidential election, but he is not known for making big political donations - but he does lend his name to some very bad people.  On the plus side, he is known as a major philanthropist, giving millions of dollars to fight hunger, help kids, provide scholarships and other very very good things.

My friend from Turkey was with me and I pointed out to her that Chick-Fil-A was a southern staple from Atlanta ,GA and that she has to try it.  From the get go, I realized this was a converted Checkers(or maybe Rallys). They only had outdoor seating and you could order at the window so if it's a rainy day, I wouldn't recommend coming here unless it was through the drive thru.  

I've been vegetarian for the last 3 years so I had two fries and my friend had the grilled chicken sandwich meal.  We ordered sat down and within 5-10 minutes we had our food.  Exactly what I expect out of a Chick-Fil-A.  The food was standard, waffle fries along with Polynesian sauce and BBQ....hits the spot every time.  My friend seemed to really like it.

The service here is great. All the employees are extremely patient and friendly.

The spicy chicken sandwich is actually spicy here! At other locations, you don't even taste the spice so it's typically not worth paying extra. I'm pleasantly surprised. Everything thing else I've tried tastes the same as usual.

1027,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"This was a happy weekend, a very happy weekend.

We woke up bright and early on Saturday and finished our morning errands. Then around lunch time the kids, Mrs. T., and I decided we wanted a casual lunch. Normally we try to adventure out into the crazy ""mom and pop"" places here in Austin, but it seems a lot of these places can put a strain on the wallet!

It just so happens we were all in our local electronic's store, Fry's, when we got our T.-family hunger pains. We asked one of the gentlemen that worked there where we could get something local and cheap. Without hesitation he said, ""Chic-Fil-A."" I was perplexed, Chic-Fil-A...that sound expensive or like a French clothing line. I asked Mrs. T. as she owns some French dresses, but she was equally confused. I told him that we weren't looking for a fancy restaurant, but he said it was casual (which is exactly what we were looking for) and kid friendly (which was a bonus).

So we went down the street on the good ol' Missouri-Pacific and found ourselves at Chic-Fil-A.

By George! I'm hooked! The owner, Mark Ortega, greeted us as we walked in. They are pretty relaxed there as they let you sit where you want! No hostesses bossing you around, imagine that! Turns out in order to save you money, you order at the front. I've seen this practice in other small Mom and Pops I've been to (and I'm glad its catching on). 

The kids had the small chicken morsels, Mrs. T. had the grilled sandwich, and I had the ""original."" All I have to say is that they are divine. The chicken must be marinated in some secret locally-made marinade, and the breading must have been from Heaven.

Here's an interesting fact: I read that this little casual/local eatery invented the chicken sandwich! Whoa!! Mark that as another awesome invention to come out of Austin. Bravo, Chic-Fil-A. 5 stars!",0.06701388888888887,Positive

Last week I came through the drive-thru and ordered a 12-count meal w/large vanilla iced coffee. I do also have the calendar card and this month's ""mystery offer"" is their new BBQ chicken sandwich (or so I was told-twice. But we will get to that) Drove away and started drinking the coffee and it was terrible. I called them right away to inform them that the syrup might be bad so they should check it, spoke with the manager and she wrote me down for a free coffee my next visit.
Flash forward to today. Picked my sister up from work and came across the street for lunch. Ordered the mystery offer (in which the employee validate once again that it was the BBQ chicken sandwich), the large iced coffee, and a large fry. Came to the window, gave the lady my calendar card, my receipt from my last purchase to get my coffee, and then my debit card. She told me the total was $7.55 and she swiped my card. She saw my confusion and said ""The mystery offer is an ice cream cone"". Really? I told her no it's not and refused to take my bag, the guy validated while I was at the board and last week while I was here. The manager came over and says ""I'm sorry, but it has changed"". She didn't even try to sound helpful or ""sorry"" in any kind of way. I told her she can go ahead and take that sandwich off and she gave me a receipt for the money back on the card. 
As a manger, you would think that you would properly communicate with the rest of your employees that there has been a change in the mystery offer; if you have the order already in, the sandwich already in the bag and being handed over, you should honor it. But instead, you throw the sandwich away and ask me if I want a damn ice cream cone. I think not.

1059,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"A funny thing happened on the way to a chicken sandwich...

I'll admit.  I've avoided the Braker and Research location of Chick-Fil-A for years even though I work in the area.  The intersection backs up every direction, and that whole parking lot LOOKS like a hot mess.  But a coworker the other day suggested picking up at drive thru, and since they were driving, who was I to complain?

Now they've turned the whole parking lot into a Disneyland line.  They have multiple car lines, going every which direction, multiple staff standing in the lot taking orders (and non-cash payments) electronically, many signs trying to bring organization to the chaos.  I was expecting to see one of them say ""From this point on, your wait for waffle fries is 45 minutes"", and was looking for the FastPass machine. 

But the result was shockingly fast drive thru service.

Fast forward two weeks, and an out-of-town coworker had a craving for the old #1, so we decided to eat in.  Even in the noon hour, we easily found a parking spot and walked in.  The place was full, but every register was open.  No wait in line, and then we get a NUMBER for our table.  Delivered to your table fast food?  And then being asked if we had everything we needed, instead of just dumping it off?  Shut the front door!

A subsequent staffer asking if ""everything was OK"" caught us off guard.  Two more stops offering (and happily getting us) drink refills was shocking.  Table clearing, but not in a way that made it seem like they wanted us to leave, caught us off guard.  

Then the kicker.  When asked if we needed ""anything else"", my friend coyly mentioned wanting a ""Banana Pudding Shake"".  The helpful staffer said ""What size to you want?  The Small is $2.78.""  (I might not have the number right, but he did)  So he took the $3, and came back in a few minutes with my friend's shake and the change.

Amazing.  At a fast food place.

I'm a sucker for the regular fried chicken sandwich.  Sure, I'll eat the grilled when I want to be ""good"" (with waffle fries, of course), but the #1 is their bread and butter.  (btw, they butter their sandwich bread)

If your review says ""I had the salad and a fruit cup, and have no idea what everyone is going on about..."", then  you're doing it wrong.

If you give one star because they are closed Sunday, and don't do the same for any other place that might be closed on a Monday, then you're just being a douche.

If you're against styrofoam cups, or a company that makes donations to certain organizations, then you are a stronger person than I.

I thought ordering would take forever, but Chick-Fil-A had it beautifully organized.  Cars were divided into two lines, and employees walked up to each car with their portable electronic order pad, completing your order efficiently right in front of you.  Other employees scurried out periodically and handed bagged orders to the waiting cars.  This system was obviously designed to serve a lot of customers quickly with a minimum of fuss, and it worked very well.

My sandwich was enjoyably spicy, but could have been constructed better.  If they switched to a slightly larger bun (to better hold up to the chicken) and added lettuce and tomato (instead of just three Lilliputan pickle slices), they would have an awesome product.",0.09019607843137255,Positive

1071,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"So, I wouldn't normally review a fast food restaurant. BUT I had an incredible experience here that definitely warrants a positive yelp review.

I eat here a lot because it's about 15 minutes away from where I work. I usually get lunch to-go (reasonably fast considering the amount of cars in the drive-thru) and eat at my desk in the office. One time, I ordered a regular chicken sandwich (the #1) on a really busy day and realized when I got back to the office that I received something healthy. It was a grilled chicken sandwich with wheat bread and veggies.

I was disappointed because I like my fried food. A coworker who also ordered from Chick-Fil-A called to complain that our order was wrong.

THIS IS THE INCREDIBLE PART.

The owner of the restaurant answered and apologized. Since we couldn't return to the restaurant to exchange the order (I only have so long for my lunch break) he DELIVERED a new chicken sandwich to my work, still warm.

Let me repeat that. THE CHICK-FIL-A RESTAURANT OWNER DELIVERED A HOT CHICKEN SANDWICH TO MY OFFICE AT WORK.

Is this even a thing? I mean, WHO DOES THAT?! I was impressed and remain impressed to this day. Other places who DO deliver will mess up orders and make me travel to the store to make it right. They suck. I love Chick-Fil-A in general but having the owner himself deliver a chicken sandwich to me directly and apologize to my face? Wow. I almost wanted to apologize for making him travel to my work just to give me a sandwich. Amazing. I love the food here but this restaurant has an incredible owner/manager to want to go out of their way to make something right like that.

The entire establishment was spotlessly clean, from the glass to the parking lot to the floors and restrooms to the seating and tables.  CLEAN.  And this not more than an hour after the lunch rush.  After every diner left their table, an attendant systematically wiped down their seats and dining surfaces with a mild chlorine solution that was still strong enough for me to smell from the booth across the aisle.  The courteous staff were all friendly and actually smiled and asked how they could assist us throughout the time we were there, but not intrusively so.  

We ordered the signature chicken sandwiches and fries with milkshakes and a couple of dipping sauces (they have many).  My fellow diner ordered her sandwich without a bun wrapped in lettuce.  The sandwiches were enclosed in a little skirt that caught all of the stray juices--a detail which made a big difference.  The food was fresh, hot and of an extremely high quality that did not taste like fast food.  I normally avoid chicken because it is nearly always overcooked, overseasoned or even rancid.  This over-the-top wonderfully juicy chicken was perfectly prepared with a delicately fresh flavor.  The sealed packages of tasty dipping sauces only enhanced the meal--they would make the food of several Chick-fil-A competitors much more palatable if I'd had the presence of mind to save some for later.  There was a thoughtfully provided basket where you could drop off any unused dipping sauces.  The milkshakes were also extremely good and definitely made of real ice cream--very rich and flavorful.  

The dining area was well designed with translucent glass panels around the booths to separate you from your diners on the other side--an attractively efficient use of space that kept the well-lit area from feeling too small or dark.  I took the time to thank one of the staff who was cleaning across from me--I was that impressed with the whole operation--and I filled out a glowing comment card.

Is that why people love this place so much? The sauce was also fine.

Meal comes with delicous golden waffle fries. The condiments are plenty and are high quality. If you want stuffore spicy-- you can always add some Texas Pete Hot Sauce. It's one of my favorites. Not too much vinegar or sugar. Great kick and not peppery. 

Consistent sandwiches and the staff is always polite. The crowd can me a bit overwhelming sometimes so just be prepared for a wait.",0.19288515406162465,Positive

This place was very popular; very busy.  The chicken sandwiches were pretty good, as well as their fries.  It was different experience from going to another burger joint (think Five Guys).  Reminded me of the Southern-type of chicken sandwich that McDonalds had awhile ago (with pickles), but much better here.

1104,Chick-fil-A,1.0,"What was a stop at a higher and fast food ""restaurant ""ended up being a very disappointing visit.

First I'll start with the food, I think is pretty tasty and like I said on the higher end of fast food however it is a bit overpriced for the quantity you get. I will equate it to Bergerville in terms of overall bang for your buck as far as quantity goes, but I would take Bergerville over Chick-fil-A nine out of 10 times. We spent 12 to 13 bucks and had a couple of teeny chicken strips and a rather small chicken sandwich and a small portion of french fries and a couple of drinks.

Onto the service, which is what gets this location the rating that it has. I've been here probably four times and I would say two of those times I had exceptional service I would give it 4 of 5 stars.  The other two times were polar opposite visits then the previously mentioned ones. This last one on Wednesday the 25th takes the cake.

I'm out the front Counter getting ready to place an order when the staff at the drive-through which is right next to front counter crank up the radio. The songs are playing is a hip hop song about cocaine and how the singer loves cocaine, will go loco and kill someone and several times in the song uses some very colorful language.  ""F"" the popo and dropping the N word as well.

No I have no problem with music being verbally charged like that, I listened to more than my share of it when I was younger too. I was always respectful enough though not the subject other people's kids to hearing derogatory racial slurs or cussing, that just is uncalled for especially at a place of business such as this.  Chick-fil-A has a reputation of being very family orientated and conscientious of everybody's beliefs and feelings, however the staff do not act in such a manner as was displayed on this evening.

I was in line with a nine-year-old when this music comes on and the girls in the drive-through start dancing around and twerking, and the kid with me has this look on his face like he can't believe what he's hearing or seeing.  He is not overly sheltered, but I don't play this kind of music for him to hear.

I had asked the girl who is ringing us up to have them turn it down they should be playing that in this establishment and we look out in the dining room and there's other families out there that are staring up at the counter with a looks of disgust at what they are hearing.  Ignoring us really, she said oh I'm sorry I know and then proceeded to finish our transaction.

As soon as she was done she turned around to walk the opposite direction to go clean tables. Didn't say a word to the staff back there having a good all-time and shaking booties to this very inappropriate song for that place and time.

I walked by the staff who rang us up as we were walking to the table with our food and said to her - can you have the manager come talk to me please, to which she replied sure.

We're about halfway through the meal and I could see the manager talking to her and the other staff before coming over to talk to me and she walks up saying I heard you wanted to talk to me? I expressed to her what had happened and how inappropriate that is for a family establishment and she said in a condescending way oh I understand they lost their music privileges now. I was outside and I didn't know.  It was plainly obvious that she just didn't really care, and she really is pretty close the same age as the other staff having a party while they work in the drive-through so that doesn't surprise me.

I won't be back to this location, and I try not to eat fast food much at all so there's a good possibility Chick-fil-A Will be eliminated from my rotation regardless of the location.",0.09722567287784681,Positive

In fact, at first, one lane of the street was actually cordoned off just for cars waiting in line to get into their parking lot!  Well, the big crowds are gone now, so I finally went to check them out.  My first impression was that their seating area is quite spacious for a fast food place. . .well, I suppose it needs to be large to handle the kind of crowds they got.  I know people love the chicken sandwiches there because of their good quality and the chicken is cooked fresh when it's ordered.  Anyway, NOW I realize that I should have ordered some type of regular sandwich on a bun instead of a wrap because the chicken on a sandwich would have been freshly cooked and hot.  I was (unwittingly) trying to limit my carbs and ordered the less ""bulky"" grilled chicken wrap.  I was disappointed that the chicken in my wrap was cold, so obviously it wasn't freshly grilled.  It was OK, but I feel that I didn't get the full mythical Chick-fil-A ""experience"" that a hot, freshly prepared sandwich would have provided.

I got the Grilled Chicken Club & my son got the Chicken Nuggets with waffle fries and milk.

The lines were crazy! But free food does that I suppose.

The employees were all really attractive. It doesn't make me want to eat there of not eat there but they were all really attractive.

My chicken sandwich was REALLY DRY. I didn't notice until later that there was a sauce packet in the bag. Typically the condiments are on the sandwiches already. It would've been nice to have mayo on it. I looked at the packet and didn't think my sandwich needed to be any sweeter than it already was so I ate it dry.

The chicken has a really sweet tinge to it that I didn't care for. The nuggets too. Just sweet. 

The fries are pretty good but fries are pretty good other places too. 

I think it's fun for people to dress up and go out. It's a nice fun family friendly place.

They have a kids play area, so big bonus points for that.

1117,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"We were finally able to get in to this place after the hype of it started slowly dying. We've heard good of this place; delicious, juicy sandwiches, crisp fries, etc. Ordered some kid's meals and combos.

...wasn't really thrilled...

First off, the sandwich was sub par. Not juicy as everyone has told me. It was borderline dry. No, it wasn't as busy (only a few people in ordering at the time, 3 cars in queue at the drive thru), so it had to be sauced more than I'd like. 

The kid's chicken nuggets were highly disappointing. We were expecting at least some decent cut of chicken, but ended up with portions equivalent to that of the little nibblets that you get at the end of a bag of frozen chicken thighs. 

The only thing we really enjoyed was the waffle fries. I'm fact, that was one of the redeeming qualities that the restaurant had.

The other thing was the customer service. They were nice and refilled our drinks while we sat and watched the kids play in the little play area. Really courteous and one of the reasons why this place didn't get a lower rating. 

Because of the hype of this place, trying to find parking in the already rediculously small parking lot makes it a waiting game for a spot or a impromptu hike from adjoining parking areas. We were going to an adjoining restaurant to here, only to find myself circling the 2 parking lots (one proper the other an annex) for several minutes (the place we were going to wasn't busy,  majority of the crowd as at Chic)

I have been to Chick-fil-A, 7 years ago when I was in California, since then
I have never been near a Chick-fil-A and I am so happy we have finally reunited.
 
Since we were shopping at Clakamas Mall on a Saturday night and we were so close to
 Chick-Fil-A, we stopped by to get food before we headed off to our hotel. 

 Did you know  that the owner of Chick-Fil-A gives their employees Sundays off so they can spend time with family which means they are closed on Sundays!! This is such a wonderful thing to do! 

When we arrived, the parking lot was a mess, and the drive thru was packed. My other half waited in the car since he couldn't find parking. I walked in to get our orders. The line wasn't as bad as the drive thru. The cashier was very patient and answered all of my questions, since it has been too long.  

I ordered our spicy chicken sandwiches and the famous waffles fries and when the cashier asked what kind of sauce would you like? ah the memories, I said can you give me one of each. 

As I bite in to my spicy chicken sandwich, which was so crispy, so fresh and cooked just right. No unprocessed meat at all, Tasted so good and so amazing, just as I remembered.
 Dipping my waffle fries and trying out all the different sauces, Yums!! I loved the waffle fries, so crispy and the sauce accompanied it so well.

1134,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"Based on the traffic jam out front, a line of cars on both sides of the street waiting to turn into the parking lot at 3:00 on a Saturday, clearly I'm the ""odd gal out"" with my take on Chick-fil-A. Could be that I'm not into fast food chains, preferring awesomeness from a food cart any day. And since food carts are everywhere in Portland, no need for the chains. 

After trying the chicken nuggets and mac & cheese at the Beaverton location and being far from satisfied, I decided to give Chick-fil-A another try based on the encouragement of Yelp friends. Plus, full disclosure, I took the phone survey on the receipt and they rewarded me with a free chicken sandwich!

Refusing to wait in that traffic jam to go through the drive thru for mediocre food, I parked and walked in. Far better choice. Was immediately greeted and was first in line to order.  Note to people, get out of the car and walk in! This time they offered me sauce, which is needed for the chicken, and I selected the ranch. They handed me a beeper thing and within minutes my sandwich arrived. I was extremely impressed with the level of customer service they provide. Had no idea they brought the food to your table; I assumed like all fast food chains, you wait to retrieve your tray of food at the counter. 

There was plenty of seating inside. High tops, booths, tables - all with a small vase of flowers. The place was clean, the stations where you get napkins and condiments was stocked and clean. At 3:00, it looked like prime dinner hour.  Clearly people love Chic-fil-A!

Opened my tin foil pac and was surprised by how small the sandwich was for the price, not my free price but what one would typically pay. And other than two tiny pickle slices, thin slices, there was nothing. No lettuce, no tomato. Hmmm. I put the ranch dressing on the spicy chicken (last time I had regular which had no flavor) and went for it. It was OK. Not bad, not great.  Satisfied my hunger since I had left the house at 8am, swam an hour at the gym, then ran errands at 5+ stores. But it was nothing I now crave and would ever decide I wanted to have for lunch. But as far as fast food chains go, it was decent. 

I just think I'm not the demographic. If I had kids and needed a quick meal, I could see this being a viable option. But I go to McDonalds maybe 3-4 times a year when I am craving a sausage and cheese muffin, and that's literally it for me and fast food joints. I also don't do Olive Garden (it's so not good Italian food), Applebee's or any of the mid tier food chains. I'm more of a local hole-in-the wall, food cart, or individually owned restaurant kind of person. 

Huge kudos to Chic-fil-A for their super friendly and efficient customer service and cleanliness. They make a good product and definitely know what their customers want, and it's ok that I'm the outlier.",0.1455448717948718,Positive

And in the spot where you wait for food.

Honestly, I was blown away.  I realize that a new place like this is going to create a sort of cult around it and people are going to be intrigued, but the customer service, to start, was mishandled.  I arrived about 10 minutes before they stopped serving breakfast.  I didn't get to the front of the line until 30 minutes after they stopped.  there was no apology, nobody pre-emptively taking orders (like they were doing in the drive through), it was just wait there for your chance to order and then get shuffled off to the side so you could then wait for your order.  There was nothing from the cashier apologizing for my delay or giving me even a time estimate on how long my food would take.  No, after I paid for my two sandwiches and chicken strips, I had to wait another ten minutes to get my food.  Invariably, once I did get it-it was just warm.

I was there for  45 minutes before I got to eat food that wasn't even hot.  Perhaps the flavor would have been better had I been eating hot food, but what I ended up having is a overpriced chicken sandwich that I wouldn't be able to tell it was different from McDonalds/Wendy's/BK.  Yes, I could have notified them that my food was not hot and I would prefer something hot, but I was famished at this point and I couldn't see waiting another 10 minutes to make my ""fast food"" experience go even longer.    The only reason my review is not a single star is the place was well seated, clean and had a nice little play area for the kids (very little).  The outdoor seating was nice as well, though some bike parking wouldn't have been a bad idea.

Seriously, skip this place-you aren't missing out on anything.",0.0870092551127034,Positive
1136,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"Compared to the Hillsboro location, this place is seriously lacking in speed.  The design and location of this restaurant is seriously awful. 

They should've designed two Full drive-through lanes for the continuous large amount of patrons who frequent this location.  And the bad part is... The population is surely to grow. 

One of the ordering stations in the drive-through was blocked off and closed on a Saturday night?     

I was in the drive-through, slow slow slow. The drive-through did not move for eight minutes and that is a very long time for a fast food restaurant.  

I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries. They were both delicious and therefore the reason I have given them two stars today instead of one. 

24 minutes from start to finish in a drive-through with one lane is ridiculous.",-0.1034920634920635,Negative

1138,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I'm so glad to have Chick Fil A back in Clackamas. I sure wish they had more parking, but that's the only down-side I can think of to this place. 

The service is fantastic, super friendly and fast- especially considering they just opened. They were very well organized. It was crowded but very clean inside and out. 

The food was very good, pricey for fast food, but higher quality too.

The spicy chicken sandwich is my favorite but I can't eat it every day. It's not too spicy for an adult but for a child or anyone who doesn't like a little kick, it gets a little too hot towards the end. 

The regular chicken sandwich is mild and not too salty or bready. Both taste best fresh, if you let them sit, the bun will get a bit greasy (you know, like fast food?)  

The sandwiches come with pickle but not with lettuce or any condiments like mustard or mayo. They have a fry sauce called Chick Fil A sauce that is good to add onto the sandwiches and for dipping the fries in. 

I always loved the regular sandwiches but my new favorite is the wrap. I haven't tried all of the sauces and dressings yet because there are so many of them but so far  my favorite is the ranch. I think it's called garlic ranch but it doesn't have an overpowering garlic flavor. I like the italian too. 

The waffle fries are good, I like to add some extra salt to them. They have regular and diet fresh lemonade, along with soda and milkshakes. 

They serve breakfast too, but I don't get up early enough for that...",0.22199242424242427,Positive
1139,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"I'm almost embarrassed to post this.  Yesterday was my first time ordering from Chick-fil-A.  I was SO NERVOUS after all the hype.  My expectations were once again high.  

I ordered through DoorDash.  The delivery was fast even with it being dinner rush.  I got the spicy chicken sandwich, macaroni and cheese, waffle fries, and the frosted lemonade.  

Wow.  I don't know where to start!  The sandwich was pure quality.  Fresh, hot and juicy chicken, crisp and delicious with the right amount of spice.  The waffle fries were great for what they were, no complaints.  

But the macaroni and cheese was legit 11/10.  I am so picky about Mac and cheese.  I don't even like classic kraft.  I'm more of a beechers fan.  I was not expecting this dish to be as good as it is.  I will return many times for this alone.

1140,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I usually don't write reviews on the same day as having frequented an establishment.  The timing can be all over the map.  However, today, a staple of Southern Americana came (back) to the Portland metro area.  Chick-fil-A opened a new store in Clackamas and, while the last one was in the food court at Clackamas Town Center when there was an ice skating rink there, this one occupies the site across the street where Chevy's Mexican Restaurant used to be.  

The store is a nice one and, with its brickwork and trellises, looks like it could fit in quite well in the burbs of its hometown Atlanta.  Incidentally, College Park, GA is really its hometown.  (College Park is where you may very well be picking up your rental car, parking your car on a long-term basis, or getting some ""shut eye"" if using ATL airport).  The interior is large and airy, with ample space around the counter area and with a vast seating area.  The interior is also slightly rustic, harkening minimally to Cracker Barrel, another native of the South.  Maybe they're ""kissin' cousins.""  Let's not go there.

Moving onto the food, it's boilerplate Chick-fil-A and it has seemingly remained unchanged. That's a good thing.  Mostly, it's about the chicken sandwiches, which come in different forms.  For healthier fare, I prefer the grilled version, which also costs a little more.  Then, I had to sabotage its healthiness by ordering it ""club"" style, which includes Colby cheese and bacon.  The waffle cut fries have a good, lighter than usual ""potato-y"" taste and differ from those of Carl's Jr., which I also find to be good.  True to their Atlanta area roots, they feature Coca Cola products.  Thankfully, they do carry Cherry Coke, which I like, and had mixed with Coke Zero.  With all that said, the chicken patty in my burger was tender and flavorful, thus almost perfect.

The employees taking the orders and attending to the seating area were very polite, but then I find that employees further out in Clackamas, Washington, and Clark Counties tend to be more polite in fast food locales.  I'm withholding the 5th star because, while it's not ""as good as it gets"" in the realm of fast food, I'm definitely a fan, having eaten at the Chick-fil-A in Peachtree Center in downtown Atlanta some 2 or 3 times a week when I ""rode the rails"" (read MARTA) there.  The other thing is that, for this very typical trio, it's priced about a third of the way up between regular fast food and a chain operated ""fern bar,"" but then Chick-fil-A is better than most fast food.

To commemorate Chick-fil-A's arrival to Clackamas, I came up with a brief jingle for the occasion.  Here it is:

Southern folks often greet others with a twangy ""hey""
But I say, ""Hey, today is a fine day,
'Clacka-fornia' got a brand spankin' new Chick-fil-A,
And you can see it from Clackamas Town Center across the way""",0.1240632515632516,Positive

While many of my favorite Southern fast-food choices aren't available up here (Bojangles, Waffle House), there are a handful of Chick-Fil-A restaurants around for me to enjoy.

While Taco Bell simply suggests its customers ""think outside the bun"", Chick-Fil-A takes it one step further, using a grammatically challenged cow who encourages you to ""eat more chikin"" in an attempt to save his bovine ass.

Chick-Fil-A makes the best fast-food chicken nugget or finger I've ever tasted, and they lay claim to the invention of the chicken sandwich (though not the chicken itself).  Unfortunately for us New Englanders, most of the local Chick-Fil-A's are located in mall food courts and offer a limited menu.  Most conspiculously absent is their amazing chicken biscuit breakfast sandwich.  Sure, it's just a piece of chicken and a buttermilk biscuit, but it sure is amazing.  

Going to the mall usually means stocking up on shitty food while you're there, but if there's a Chick-Fil-A near by, at least your fast food can be delicious.  C-F-A is to chicken what In-N-Out is to burgers.  Must be something about having dashes in your name.",0.038096929112554107,Positive

They also have chicken nuggety things, cole slaw, fruit salad, brownies, and a few other sides. My boyfriend and I usually get 2 chic- fil-a value meals which comes to about $11. Not too bad and the food is far superior to the other fast food chains in the food court like Taco Bell, Sbarro, and McDonald's. I only have one complaint. They don't serve breakfast!!! When I was in high school in VA, everyone would skip class to get the chicken biscuits which was basically a little piece of chicken on a biscuit. Soo delicious. 
Oh! Also be aware that Chic-Fil-A is closed on Sundays. Not just this one, but all of them in the entire company. They observe Sunday as the day of rest. I find that quite admirable.",-0.043307823129251695,Negative

The joint is usually packed during the lunch rush, but the friendly and efficient staff move the lines along quickly. I like to get my order to go, and grab a seat in the bustling Colony Square atrium, where the people-watching is a pastime in and of itself.

Also, I'm a hater of fast food and all things fried, so take that into consideration before reading anything below!

I just don't get the Chick-fil-a thing. People here have a love for it that borders on obsession, and I just think it's kind of..... ick. 

Ick-fil-a.  Granted, their ""lightly breaded"" (aka fried) chicken sandwiches that they ""invented"" are much better than similar sandwiches elsewhere, I just think the healthier options for those of us in need of a quick bite without the potential for a minor heart attack need a few healthy options on the menu that are at least semi-satisfying. The grilled chicken strips on the salads resemble the stuff you'd find in the vacuum-packed pouches of pre-seasoned chicken strips in Kroger's refrigerated section. The grilled chicken breast on the sandwich is also weak. The BBQ and the honey mustard dipping sauces are just not good. Ick, ick, ick.

The 1,000 calories milkshakes also frighten me, and I worry about the health of my loved ones that drink them fairly often. The chicken biscuits, though I'm sure they're tasty since my brother ate one every morning on his way to high school, do not seem like such a great way to start the day off. Ick.

The one recent memory I have of Chick-fil-a that prompted me to write this pointless review of an extremely popular, much loved chain involved some nugget trays I had catered for a middle school afterschool event. I was designated the official server, and I slapped on some plastic gloves and started heaping the nuggets on the trays of the very eager, hungry students. Anyways, I went through FIVE pairs of gloves for just two nugget trays because the grease seeped through them and began dripping down past my wrists. When everything was done, I washed my hands with a buttload of soap and still couldn't get the shiny, oily feeling off my hands. ICK!

The 2 stars are definitely for the reliable catering and delivery services I've utilized at least 10 times for work (my boss is the biggest Chick-fil-a fan I know), and they're also for the incredible Diet Lemonade and fruits cups available in assorted sizes (with a good selection of fruit in them, too). Their marketing strategies and the Chick-fil-a cows are definitely damn cool. I mean, everyone I know loves this place, so I know there's something to it (my middle school students seriously ate every crumb off the trays). Old college friends of mine that visit from the north always want to try it, and I just sigh.

And let me tell you...I fell in love with after that first bite into their grilled chicken sandwich (with extra pickles!)..and that is still my to go sandwich (&& I rarely like to eat sandwiches or burgers)! 

Throughout the years, I feel like the quality and services of Chik-fil-A at the Ocoee branch (also including the ones located at Winter Garden, Waterford, and Kirkman) have improved so much. I used to hate going here, especially around lunch hours since it is always packed with people but with their most recent renovation, I do not find it to be a hassle anymore. The environment is clean. The staffs are friendly and very professional. The pace is quick. The foods is fresh, warm/hot and delicious. The soft serve is to die for especially during Florida's intense heatwave. I don't know about you but I surely do not have anything to complain about. 

Out of all their items on the menu, I always enjoy their grilled chicken sandwich and Cobb salad. Those two item, are by far, my favorites at Chik-fil-A! And lets not forget about their classic waffles fries and nuggets. With some Polynesian+ketchup+hot sauce combo, I am a forever happy...until I am hungry again anyway haha. 

Moreover, there was one particular moment that I will never forget. During that time, I was into the ""salad crave"" phase and I particularly like their Cobb salad description...I was hesitant to try it out at first since I did not like the cheese toppings. I asked one cashier if it is possible to get it without cheese and she answered ""no"" with a tone of feeling annoyed by my request. Personally, I do not mind and was mentally prepared to spend my time  picking out all the cheese strands but the way she replied to my question kind of threw me off. But I was whatever about it. Though that may be, luckily, another cashier came to my rescue and said ""I will take care of it...it is always possible to have your salad without cheese upon request at anytime."" She was my knight in shining amor and I am grateful to encountered such an understanding individual like her. 

In conclusion, I love Chik-fil-A! I would love it more if they open on Sundays...haha... but I get it and I respect their choice. But oh man...

When the order was brought to my table, I was very disappointed to discover that the sandwich was completely cold. The chicken was lukewarm. The bread had not been heated and the cheese was a cold slice. 

I went up to the counter and the gentleman told me they don't have a way to melt cheese. I pointed to the picture and stated, ""It's melted in the picture on the menu."" He brought me another sandwich and the chicken and bread were warm this time, but there was still a slice of cold cheese on top of the chicken.

However, this location has consistently missed the mark almost every time I eat there and after yet another disappointing experience today I've decided to finally write a review. I go to this location regularly and it has consistently disappointed. It is very rare that the fries are fresh (in fact they are often lukewarm or cold), and when I order a salad, they absolutely never include the toppings or utensils to eat it with (when taking it to-go). Additionally, I had the worst chicken sandwich I've ever had from any Chick-Fil-A at this location. It was very clearly stale and had to have been sitting out for a long period of time. The chicken was extremely dry and the bread and pickles were completely stale to the point where the bun was hard and the pickles were clearly dried out.

I love the chicken sandwiches, waffle fries, and their salads. Their nuggets are bite sized, so great for a toddler but order a bunch if you're hungry yourself.

At least once or twice a week, I'll stop by for breakfast or lunch or dinner. There was this one time when I was guilty for going there twice in one day... But that's a story for another time! 

There are many, many fast food places in Orlando but my favorite would have to be Chick-fil-A, especially the one at this location. The staff is always so friendly, the food is always to die for. I'm obsessed with this place. 

Whenever I go here for breakfast, I always get the chicken minis (4 count), I'm disappointed because I wish it would have like a 6 or 8 count but I guess 4 will suffice for now... The chicken mini is just a very fluffy bread coated with a little bit of honey (I believe) with a chicken nugget nestled in the middle. It is always SO good. For lunch or dinner, I've enjoyed the salads, chicken sandwiches, tenders, and nuggets. My favorite dipping sauce would be the chick-fil-a sauce, polynesion, and bbq. Sometimes I mix the a little bit of all three and it's the best thing ever! Try it! I swear by it.

The restaurant itself is also very clean, which is very surprising to me considering how much traffic goes through this location.

The bathrooms are clean and smell like roses. There is always someone cleaning the tables and or windows and floors. 

I have always loved going to this restaurant but my experience grew even more magnificent when I used the drive-thru. There was easily a 20 car line wrapped around the building; I was out of there, food in hand in less than 6 minutes. That includes waiting in line before ordering.

1224,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I've been to this location twice in the past week and have had great experiences both times.

My visit last week was on the way home from running some errands. I stopped in to get a meal to take home, but there was some confusion and no one put my order together. After a few minutes of waiting, one of the cashiers asked what I was still waiting for. I handed her my receipt and she handed it to a manager who got to work collecting my food. As an apology for the wait, he threw in a three piece chicken strip - effectively doubling the size of my meal. 

I went in again today to claim my free Spicy Chicken Sandwich that they're testing. The cashier suggested/upsold me on a few add-ons that they're offering with the sandwich (pepper-jack cheese and lettuce/tomato). My food came out lightning quick this time, and I was off to try this supposedly ""spicy"" sandwich.

The concept of a ""spicy"" sandwich at a fast food restaurant is kind of an insane notion, and I never actually expect to get anything that I'd call ""spicy"" or ""hot"".  That said, this did have a tiny bit of kick to it - more than I would have expected. Granted, part of that may be from the pepper-jack cheese.

While I ate, employees were walking around checking on customers, and offering to get refills. I've been Chick-Fil-As before - including this location, but I've never seen them do that before. 

There was also a person in a cow costume (no clue if there's an official mascot name) walking around entertaining the kids and whatever adults were amused enough to interact with them. 

This location is super clean - kept spotless by the number of employees roaming the dining room.

Since they were testing the new sandwich, a couple of employees stopped by to ask my opinions on the sandwich and offered me a free coupon for another spicy chicken sandwich when they officially launch next week.

The only real problem with Chick-Fil-A - any and all of them, really - is that I usually only get a craving for them on Sunday. I don't know if it's my subconscious that is annoyed that they're closed on Sundays and automatically craving them because I can't have them - but it's kind of annoying.",0.047643097643097654,Positive

Once inside, we ordered and got our food rather quickly.  Crispy Spicy Chicken on their ""special"" bun that the grilled chicken usually comes on and a regular chicken sandwich with cheese without pickles for the boy!

We were hungry, so started eating immediately.  These sandwiches were pretty good, but not the best.  The cheese was half hanging out of the sandwich.  The spicy had 1 pickle on the bun and the bun was a little dry and crumbly.

The waffle fries were hot and crispy which is a plus.  That's one advantage to the craziness is the fries haven't been sitting there for a while.

A really solid sandwich that I've been craving ever since I downed the last bite of it.  

The staff here are all insanely friendly as well.

So - what luck is it that I get to try it somewhere where it has been established for some time and the minor tweaks that come with first opening are of the past. 

Not your typical fast food chain, granted it is fast food. Food is delivered to you at your table and they're closed all day Sunday. Aside from that, I don't feel it's any different.

The good is good, not great. I enjoyed their fresh squeezed lemonade and the Chick-fil-A sauce with the sandwiches. Their waffle fries weren't crispy enough to my liking such as Carl's Jr., but all else was not lacking in flavor. My husband says their sandwiches are on par to what Wendy's has to offer.

1240,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"This is a fairly standard store.  They make the standard delicious chicken sandwiches.  All the food is good and like any good Chick-Fil-A.  This is a very busy location in the heart of the tourist district of LBV.  They try hard to keep the lines flowing, but are often overwhelmed.

*They've got heart at this location.*  They also have some management who love to think outside the fry box.  That's good and bad.  They do some whacky experiments at this location.  A lot of them are pretty silly.  A few of them work.

Just be aware that coming here doesn't always make sense.  They do this double lane drive-thru thing.  However, it's not always like that, it's not built for that, and sometimes it makes things really awful in the parking lot.  You can't actually see if it's operational, so if you choose poorly... you're DONE!  You have to go around the building again and get at the end of the line.  However, sometimes you're sitting there and the person comes around the corner with a look on their face like ""HEY DUMMY, USE THIS SPARE LANE.""  I promise you, though, if you went around there would have been no one standing there.  It's quite obnoxious and annoying.  This is a big fail in my book.  Frankly, this setup sometimes makes me choose somewhere else to eat.  It's that bad.

They have also done this weird thing where they have like 6 people pass your food down a chain-gang of employees to your car at the window.  It's something you have to experience in person.

They've had condiment people at a table in the drive-thru.  I'm not kidding.  Like a yard sale of condiments.

They've had a whole line of people each doing a tiny piece of your order like a production line... except your actual food comes from inside.  This was like one person takes the order, one person takes the money, one person hands you your condiments, one person gives you a drink, and one person gives you your food.  Then one person waves and tells you that it's their pleasure to serve you.

Whoever the idea person at this location is... is seriously whacked out.  They might be the goofiest fast food person in the city.  

All that said, I gave them 4 stars.  It's a very friendly store and I have yet to meet a bad egg.  They are kind and just smile/nod at you when you crack a little joke about the weird experiment of the day.  They know.  They also do what their management tells them to do.  They have only messed up my order like 2 or 3 times in the 15 years I've been occasionally going there.  Oddly, once was last week.  It's all good.  They made up for it today.  The food is hot.

We are out of town and my husband wanted just the chicken nuggets without the biscuit for breakfast and they had that available and even made waffle fries during breakfast hours for him (I don't know if this is always an option or they were just super nice). The chicken is seasoned well and they will refill your drink and have Coke Zero (which I definitely have an unhealthy obsession with). I love the grilled chicken sandwich, which tastes like it came off the backyard grill. The small shake was the free calendar item this month - we got chocolate which we weren't really impressed with - the syrup tasted like it was poor quality, but it was free so I'm not going to hate on it too much. 

They have the ketchup dippable cups which is also a nice touch for the waffle fries. This location was clean including the bathroom and they have free WiFi,.

The chicken sandwich and grilled nuggets I ordered were served hot and the vegetables in the deluxe sandwich were fresh (not soggy). The fries has a nice crunch and were clearly made upon order. Service here is always friendly and fast. When we entered there was a line of about 6 parties, which moved quite fast due to their great staffing and efficiency of their ordering and fulfillment. The restaurant was quite busy at the time, so seating was a bit sparse. However, when we finally found an open table a Chick Fil A employee quickly wiped down the table for us and asked us if we needed anything (which was a great touch).

I ordered 3 meals and they got those right without any problem. I was in line and someone came in stating they'd ordered 3 sandwiches but had only been charged for 2 and only received 2. They manager took care of the discrepancy quickly and refused to take any money for the sandwich that wasn't paid for - nice touch.

One thing that's really really nice about CFA is it seems our tourist friends from South America and the UK haven't figured out what this place is about. So, they're not here. It is a nice change of pace if you're a local or just tired of people invading your personal space. 

So, if you've spent the day pushing and shopping at the Premium Outlets nearby, this is a wonderful oasis. It's a great place to get to a clean bathroom, a cold cup of Icedream, or a Spicy Chicken Sandwich.

1247,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"A week into my stint on the Disney College Program, I had no idea that Chick-Fil-A would be one of the (many) highlights of my stay down here in Orlando. But for those of us staying at Vista Way, the 5-minute walk down the street to this heavenly chicken joint is sheer bliss (or, depending on how you look at it, incredibly dangerous).

Honestly, I sometimes feel like I'm the only one here new to the Chick-Fil-A experience, since New England is apparently the only place in the country where Chick-Fil-A's aren't all over the place. West of 495 in Mass., there literally aren't any, so you'll have to forgive my exuberance. Where I come from, Taco Bell and Dunks are the pinnacle of fast food, and that's unfortunate, because - corny as it may sound - CFA takes your perceptions of fast food and turns them on its side.

Every employee is in high spirits. The entire store, every booth, is kept in tip-top shape (saying something, considering the traffic this place gets between thrifty Disney visitors and CP students). And the food - oh, my, the food. There's something intangible about it, but the food just seems like FOOD, rather than FAST food. The presentation is the same, but everything's just so tasty. I try to keep in shape by avoiding fried food whenever I can, so I'll admit I haven't tried anything fried yet, but the grilled chicken, whether in sandwich or wrap form, is spectacular. The waffle fries are superb, as are the healthier substitutions you can get. The side salad comes with a great selection of dressings. And honestly, what other fast food joint offers Diet Dr. Pepper, the diet beverage of champions?

And if all that didn't seal the deal, how about employees who come around offering to refill your drinks for free? How about sweet deals for the CP students, like two-for-one chicken sandwiches on Thursdays (I think) and handy coupons for incoming participants? How about the free mints on your way out? And I haven't even tried the breakfast yet. All of this, mind you, at prices comparable to the ""other guys.""

I loves me some T-Bell, don't get me wrong. But I'll never look at fast food the same way again. I don't even mind the subtle ""go to church"" message implied by their not being open on Sundays.

1248,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"One thing we lack in Miami are Chick-Fil-A restaurants; you'll need to go into Dadeland Mall, or venture out to Doral, both inconvenient places for me, so when I saw one close to where we were staying in Orlando, we stopped by to enjoy a really nice chicken sandwich. 

Their famous chicken sandwiches are made from breast meat that's super moist that comes in a foil bag which traps the heat thus making the bun nice and soft. It also comes with a couple pickles and that's it; sure it's a very simple recipe but for some reason, that's all you need for this great combintion that spells a great healthy choice for fast food. 

The waffle fries were also really fresh tasting, not stale or old like some places that don't go the extra mile to ensure the rotation always works best for the patron. 

They seemed over staffed with so many people on the floor looking to clean tables, and back of house seemed like there were a ton of people too which expains us waiting almost no time for our food. Overall a top notch run franchise; I am sure they are one of the top producers for Corporate.

The food is very good, even for a fast food place. When I was here I had the chicken sandwich and it was very tasty and much better than I anticipated.

The other big plus that I didn't realize was that they will bring the food to your table after you order. This doesn't seem like a big deal but when you're dealing with a bunch of kids and have to keep your eye on them, this helps a lot. The service and staff is top notch. The staff is very polite and very helpful.

its a well known fast food chain in florida. I just found out recently that we have some locations in california too! 

all we ordered was the spicy chicken sandwich and some criss cut fries.

based on the sandwich, id say its cool.  the meat was fresh and hot.  not at all dry.  wish i could taste the spicy-ness more.  

its just your average fast food joint.

but, the only thing that stood out to me was they came around asking if we wanted our drinks refilled.  they also brought our tray of food to us at our table, and asked us if we wanted to take it away when we are done.",-0.03166666666666667,Negative
1259,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"Once again, I'm knocking on Heaven's kitchen door to ask his humble servants for a meal, as I am merely starving for poultry nutrition. Like most Chick-fil-A's, especially in the mall, the line is usually pretty long, ESPECIALLY on Saturday's or any big sale days.

The Food: On this particular day, I simply required something to ""hold me over"" until I got home. Being a grown adult, I have NO SHAME in ordering a kids meal. For me, it's just enough to do the job, which is to hold me over. Any other day, I'd get my usual Spicy Chicken Sandwich meal, but I wasn't trying to be stuffed. I ordered the 6 piece Chicken Nugget kids meal with Chick-fil-A sauce. This came with fries, a drink, and a toy (which I traded for a cup of ice cream). Of course, all the adults know the ""trade the toy for ice cream"" trick. What use do I have for a toy, when I can eat ice cream after? HELLOOOO?! 

Quick Tidbit: There are two Chick-fil-A locations in the area. This one, which is INSIDE the mall and another directly OUTSIDE the mall. This location, because it's inside the mall, is slightly higher in price. Keep that in mind when you're debating which is more beneficial for you. Either way, you'll be waiting to order.

Yesterday I asked about my order and showed the woman my app and I overheard the woman preparing the bags say she already had someone by my name. She then takes her time to even acknowledge me while the other attendant Mary continues distributing food after calling for the other woman to make a decision. So I show her that it says an attendant will be with me on my app and say my order and she asks me to go into the details of my receipt , then goes oh well that's strange. No apologies or have a nice day afterward even though she held me up after they clearly made the mistake and gave away my order to someone different.

I had the chance to talk with some people who work there today as it was sort of slow and they are great people.  I went over to try the new grilled chicken sandwich and the new grilled chicken nuggets, both of which were awesome tasting and awesome for my ever expanding waistline.

1263,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"This is by far the worst Chick-fil-a I have bet been to. I do not have a bad opinion of Chick-fil-a because every single other one I have ever been to living in Atlanta my whole life has been mostly perfect experiences. Chick-Fil-a is a great company that I feel holds its employees to extremely high standards and it shows through the service they give.

I live within a mile of this location so have been there numerous times only to be disappointed almost every single time I go. Today ( 11/11/17) was no different than what I normally expect from these people. My wife wanted Chick-fil-a and I tried to reason her to go to the McDonalds across the street which is an awesome McDonald's location. At the end of the experience I got to say.....I told you so. We will not go to this location ever again.

Asked for sauce...given wrong sauce. Lines are always stupid long at this location. Guy today rubbed snot from his nose right in front of us and then handed us our food and the wrong sauce pack cause he didn't listen to what kind we wanted. I have received wrong orders multiple times. In the past I have had rude employees at the drive through. Have gotten French fry container 3/4 full. This location is a Chick-Fail-a.

I can go get a southern style chicken sandwich across the street at McDonald's, receive better service and experience.

1264,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"There is something strangely off about this Chick-Fil-A's chicken only in chicken biscuits. I thought it was a one time thing, but after 2 other tries I found myself having to quit after one bite. 

I sent Chick-Fil-A an email about it, and they forwarded the info about it to the restaurant operator. I just got two coupons for free chicken biscuits in the mail today...they will probably not be used here because I'm scared still. But at least that is a recovery of 2 of the 3 times I could only eat the little hash browns and drink my orange juice for breakfast.

It's just weird because I've had non-breakfast food from here and there's been no problem. I'm not even sure how to describe what it is. The chicken kind of looks wet once you bite inside it and it just tastes bad. That's about all the detail I really want to go into. I seriously had to spit out a second bite if I dared to take one. 

But seriously, you see I am giving 3 stars...totally fine place any other time of day and because I just seriously love Chick-Fil-A. The chicken sandwich tastes just like that sandwich you know and love, no weird aftertastes. And I really like that they seemed to actually care about what I had to say about it rather than the last time I questioned some chain's weird food problem.

1265,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I'm a huge fan of Chick-fil-A, especially their Original Chicken Sandwich, Spicy Chicken Sandwich, and waffle fries.  However, with my commitment to Yelp's ""In It to Thin It"" (IITTI) this year, one thing I decided to cut out (at least until the end of IITTI on February 24) is deep-fried foods.  This meant that I had to try some healthy ""fast food"" options.

For some reason, I'm not generally a fan of salads at fast food restaurants.  I like mixed greens salads, and fast food places usually serve only romaine/iceberg lettuce salads.  So the last two times I picked up a quick meal through this Chick-fil-A's drive-thru, I chose items I normally would never order here.

* Chargrilled Chicken Cool Wrap (410 calories) - Per the online menu description, this consists of ""Slices of grilled chicken breast nestled in a fresh bed of Green Leaf lettuce with shredded red cabbage, and carrots, tomato slices and a subtle blend of Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses tightly rolled in multigrain flat bread. Served with choice of dressing.""  I chose the Light Italian dressing (25 calories).  Since I had never seen anyone order this, I had no idea that it wouldn't be made to order.  It was obviously made sometime earlier during the day and placed in the fridge.  I was not a fan of this as I would have much preferred a warm chicken wrap that was made to order.  I guess I should have known that it would literally be chilled since the name of the wrap contains the word ""cool.""  The wrap tasted okay and filled me up but really wasn't anything special.  I wouldn't order it again and don't recommend it.

* Chicken Salad Sandwich (510 calories) - ""Freshly made at each Restaurant, this tasty sandwich is made with chunks of our Chick-fil-A chicken breast, chopped eggs, celery, sweet pickle relish and mayonnaise served chilled with Green Leaf lettuce on toasted Wheatberry bread.""  Unfortunately, like the Cool Wrap, this sandwich is also pre-made early in the day and refrigerated.  This sandwich was decent, but I would have never known that it was from Chick-fil-A by the taste alone.  It could have come from a supermarket or gas station.  Again, I was disappointed and would not order this again or recommend it.

I just looked up the calorie count in a Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich, and I'm shocked that it's only 290 calories vs. the 410 calories in the Cool Wrap and 510 calories in the Chicken Salad Sandwich.  I also can't believe that at 440 calories, an Original Chicken Sandwich has less calories than the Chicken Salad Sandwich.  Really?!  I seriously want a Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich now.  Too bad it's Sunday and I can't get one...

Overall, this Chick-fil-A still gets 4 stars because the drive-thru service was fast and friendly.  And although I haven't had their ""normal"" (non-healthy!) fast food items here nor dined in, I'm willing to bet it's as delicious as any other Chick-fil-A and probably clean inside.  I'll be sure to update my review once I've had a chance to dine in and enjoy a full, fatty Chicken Sandwich meal very soon...

Side Note: Why doesn't Chick-fil-A serve regular (not Reduced Fat Berry-flavored) Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing?  Their Berry Balsamic is too sweet for my taste.  PLEASE give us the option to get regular (or reduced fat) Balsamic Vinaigrette!

1266,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"Sure, Chick-fil-A is a fast food chain, they're closed on Sundays, and they have some extreme right wing ideology, but despite all this they are simply the best.  

The #3 combo (spicy chicken sandwich with extra pickles, waffle fries, and a large diet lemonade) is everything.  Seriously it is so good.  This is coming from someone who doesn't eat fast food (aside from Cookout and Bojangles and alcohol is generally involved with those dining choices).  Their chicken nuggets with Polynesian sauce are addictive and a really challenge of self control to not eat like a million of them.  Their fresh fruit is actually really good, which is extra impressive because fast food fruit is in and of itself a scary thought.  They are one of the few restaurants that serve Diet Doctor Pepper.  In general, what's not to love.

However, my ""home base"" Chick-fil-A here simply goes beyond in customer service.  It's always clean and the employees are always nice and professional.  They give my dog a bone and me a gift card whenever the wait is really long.  Today I stopped in and picked up a gallon of their amazing diet lemonade to go.  The super kind employee gave me a small lemonade while I waited two minutes max for them to get my lemonade in bulk.  Now that's customer service done right!

In a nutshell, great food and even greater customer service.  It's my pleasure to dine here...that and my addiction to the diet lemonade.",0.21887755102040812,Positive

1268,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"I ordered original chicken sandwiches here on two different occasions and received some of the most inconsistent sandwiches I've ever gotten at a Chick-fil-A. The chicken breast was very, very dry and fried to a crisp. On top of that,  it was probably 2/5 the thickness of a regular sandwich. The sandwich I got probably had less than half the meat that is usually in a regular sandwich I get at any other location. I went 1 hour before closing, and just assumed that it was because they were closing shop soon, and didn't think much of it. The second time I got an original chicken sandwich, I actually ordered two. Both sandwiches had the same issue as the first order that I had. The third time I ordered from this Chick-fil-A, I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich hoping to have better results. I was mistaken. The size and thickness of the chicken I got in my grilled chicken sandwich was tiny and dry, just like the original chicken sandwich at this location. If you're looking to get the original or grilled chicken sandwich, steer clear of this location. Four sandwiches and four consecutive disappointments. It also didn't help that they also had their dumpster right next to the drive-through, and you could actually smell their garbage as you were receiving your food from their drive-through.",-0.0712797619047619,Negative

I still believe that Cfa is the shining star of the fast-food business, but this location fell short--and that doesn't usually happen.  The cashier was not nearly as friendly as I've become accustomed to.  After standing at the counter for several minutes seeking a drink refill, I finally had to reach behind the counter and do it myself.  The dining room was particularly dirty.  My chicken sandwich was particularly dark--as if it was left in the fryer too long.  A seemingly schizophrenic homeless man sitting in the corner staring everyone down didn't make my visit any better.

1273,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"The only bad thing about this Chick-fil-A location is the traffic outside, but that's expected at the busy intersection of Peachtree and Collier.  You'll have to be patient getting into and out of this place, especially during peak times.  It's not as bad in the evenings or weekends, which are the times I've mostly visited this location.

From the street, it doesn't look like there's a lot of parking, but there's actually a lot of parking in a hidden lot in the back.  This Chick-fil-A has free Wi-Fi with decent speeds, a functional drive-thru, and an indoor playground with slide for kids.  Consistent with other Chick-fil-As, service is very good -- friendly and attentive.

It's hard to go wrong with any of the menu items.  I usually spring for the spicy chicken sandwich combo (around $6) or the nuggets (about $4-5 for a dozen).  The food quality at this location is on par with the others.  I prefer the Polynesian sauce (sweet and sour), but consider mixing it up and trying the Chick-fil-A sauce or buttermilk ranch sauce if you've never tried them before.  Chick-fil-A sauce is mildly ""mustardy,"" smoky, and sweet.  I'm not a fan of the buffalo sauce. I think it's too salty and overpowering.

Sweet tea is excellent.  It's super sweet and addictive.  Hello, diabetes.

The waffle fries are always good.  If you want to eat healthy, you can swap them out for a fruit cup.  A fruit cup contains Mandarin orange slices, strawberries, chunks of red and green apple, and red grapes.  They say the cups are prepared fresh in-store, so that's a plus.

We both agreed Chick-fil-A sounded perfect - a little comfort food in the form of two Original Chicken Sandwiches (mine with no butter/no pickles, his the fancy version with lettuce, tomato, cheese etc) is just the antidote to learning your foot is fine but they will need to cut the other side of the toenail off in a couple of weeks and do a chemical treatment that basically cauterizes the toenail - right??

This CFA is hopping and based on the times I've driven past previously, it is always that way! The drive-thru was packed but this one is easier to navigate than some. We dined inside and as usual, the employees were polite, efficient and attentive - I love it that the folks now come to clear your table for you - nice touch!

1294,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"While the leadership of this company seems to love to court controversy (recently, at least), they continue to deliver a very tasty chicken sandwich.  Fried in peanut oil, the chicken has the taste of deep fried goodness without being too greasy.  I alternate between the original and spicy chicken sandwiches (both equally good), but ask them to hold the pickles.  I like the sharpness of pickles in hamburgers, but on a chicken sandwich, I feel like the taste of pickles is strong enough to eclipse the taste of the chicken.  The ""deluxe"" version of their sandwiches includes lettuce and tomato, which again I like on hamburgers, but not on a fried chicken sandwich.  

Chick Fil A also has the best sweet tea, which I particularly enjoy as an Arnold Palmer, mixed with their lemonade.  The sweetness of the tea and the tartness of the lemonade, with their powers combined, produces a very refreshing effect on my senses.

The Dwarf House serves more than just chicken sandwiches. You can get breakfast 24 hours a day and other specialties not found at a mall location.  

Don't tell the cows but you can order burgers, steaks and other food too.  The cows do approve of the Hot Brown.  And no, a Hot Brown isn't a sandwich or something you need to look up on the Internet.  You may find something unappetizing by doing a Google search for that term!  A Hot Brown is a chicken casserole-type dish garnished with bacon and toast.  Yummy!

If you are bored with the old standard Chick-fil-a sandwich, try spicing it up.  Ask for it on a grilled bun with cooked onions and cheese.  Instead of putting ketchup on it, try using the House salad dressing or Heinz 57 sauce.

I decided to go the full-service route (on a barstool since I was alone on business), and am glad I did. One review suggested the regular chicken sandwich was bigger & better than other Chick-Fil-A restaurants, but I disagree. It tasted exactly the same as the ones in Texas, and I actually think the chicken was smaller here. So don't order the standard chicken sandwich if you go there -- get one of the unique items. I wasn't able to find a menu of the unique items online (and the lady on the phone didn't seem interested in giving me a comprehensive list over the phone), so maybe this list will help some of you that are wondering just HOW different the full-service menu is:

Lunch/Dinner menu (in addition to normal stuff):
One-piece plate, two-piece plate, chargrilled one-piece plate, chargrilled two-piece plate, steak plate, Hot Brown (other reviews describe this), hamburger plate, midnight sandwich (ham & cheese), ham/bacon lettuce tomato sandwich, giant burger, steak sandwich, dwarf burger, grilled cheese sandwich, kids meal.

Vegetables:
fried okra, fried peas, collard greens, mashed potatoes, sweet potato souffle, cornbread, mac & cheese, kernel corn, green beans, broccoli & cheese. Also note they serve ""straight"" fries if you ask for them instead of the traditional waffle fries (I only saw waffle fries on their menu sign but was able to order straight fries).

Breakfast (served all day):
Eggs & toast & grits (bacon, ham, or sausage optional), steak & eggs, Chick-Fil-A chicken & eggs, chicken egg & cheese bagel, waffle, cinnamon cluster, etc.

And they have individual slices of pies - some fried and some regular. I had the lemon and it was great (tart but that's how I like it).

I tried the regular chicken sandwich (same as everywhere), dwarf burger (small but perfect when sampling other things too), straight fries (pretty standard fries - medium size sticks -- fatter than other fast food fries), and a small slice of lemon pie (the most enjoyable thing I ordered, which is how it's supposed to work). 

I'd love to go back someday and try some of the other unusual items on the menu -- including breakfast!  The nice server at the bar gave me 3 little stuffed cow toys as souvenirs for my 3 young kids back home -- but only when I asked (like other reviews have said).

You sit, a server takes your order, you wait for it to be cooked. It does come out quickly, but it's not sitting under a heat lamp for hours waiting for you. Prices are the same if you average it all out, and it's classic Chick-fil-a at it's best.

The neat thing about this location, though, is that it's the original. Yup, it all started here, folks. Everything from that tiny red door (which I still fit through, by the way...) to a diner look and feel to those silly paper hats rest inside these hallowed walls.

Don't come here and get what you can get at any location around the country. Come here and get things you can't get elsewhere, like the Hot Brown or a salad with Chick-fil-a's House dressing, all served ONLY at Dwarf House locations which, of course, are only in the Atlanta area.

Of course they are still closed on Sunday, but you can come any other day of the week and satisfy those cravings in the oldest Chick-Fil-A establishment there is. And seriously, get the Hot Brown. The artery clogging is only temporary, promise...",0.06541666666666666,Positive

1330,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"If there isn't an ounce of nostalgia or regard for Chick-fil-A history in your bones, then coming here really is unnecessary. But if you really do love Chick-fil-A a lot, are a chicken sandwich addict, want to try items that you can't get anywhere else and have a soft side for their history, then you must make this pilgrimage to Atlanta.

Yes, this is THE original location of Chick-fil-A, where what I believe to be the greatest chicken sandwich was ever created. 

Everything about this restaurant is different from your typical Chick-fil-A. First, this location is open just about around the clock. They also have servers to provide table service and there are a plethora of non-typical Chick-fil-A items to choose from on their menu. They have various platters, lots of sides, salads, soups, special sides, dessert and breakfast platters. When we went, if I didn't know any better, I would have thought I was in some random diner that just happened to specialize in chicken.

As a major foodie, I had done my fair share of research prior to coming here so my wife and I thought we knew what was best to get. Every article and review pointed to the Hot Brown as their signature dish, so I went with that. It came with a salad, but who's getting salad at Chick-fil-A? C'mon. I swapped out the salad for waffle fries. My wife ordered the Grilled Chicken Melt Platter with Waffle Fries and Fried Okra. 

The verdict? Meh and meh. Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered. I read the description on the menu and wasn't too excited about the Hot Brown, but I proceeded against my own will anyway. I should have listened to my gut. The Hot Brown was this unappetizing combo of chopped chicken, cream sauce and cheddar cheese. It was a gooey mess in a small tray that pretty much tasted like it sounded. I couldn't get a grip of the flavor of the chicken because the cream sauce and cheese dominated it. The gooeyness of the dish was a turnoff too. My wife wasn't a fan of her chicken melt platter either. It was all very plain and didn't have much flavor to it.

When we first walked in, all I could think about was what I typically ordered at Chick-fil-As (nuggets) and why I loved the chain and my word of advice to any customers visiting is DO NOT DIVERT FROM THAT. Go with your gut and the reasons you loved Chick-fil-A in the first place. Don't try to get fancy and order things that just don't sound good, even if it's their ""signature"" dish. You'll enjoy your experience a lot more here. I'm not deterring anyone from trying new things, but in this instance, stick with the chicken you know and love.

Besides the platters we ordered, we both also ordered a Frosted Lemonade, which was something we hadn't seen elsewhere. The best way to describe it was like a creamsicle lemonade shake. It was better than I thought it would be, so that's a win there.

The service was decent here and quick. I wouldn't say the employees were friendly, but in no way were they hostile either. Most were young and just did their jobs, but didn't go out of their way to converse with customers.

Like I said, coming here won't be for everyone. It's a nice piece of history whenever you go to the 1st of anything that is now global, but if you're just seeking out a Chick-fil-A meal, then it's better to stay local.",0.11608282068808383,Positive

The people are friendly, even the customers. Spoke with Ed, a guy who has eaten here every day for 30 years! The inside looks a lot like the diners of the 60's.

This is NOT your normal Chick-fil-A. You can get most of the food here, but some items are unique. Want a hamburger? They have them. How about a chicken sandwich platter? Milk shake?

1332,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"First, my friend was the one who wanted to go to Chick-fil-A. Second, I agreed when I researched this location was the first of its breed.

Private parking lot is huge, plenty of spaces. There is a drive-through, quick fast food express, and seat-in diner. Whatever your needs may be. Due to its age, there are some worn down areas but still maintained well. 

FOOD:
Spicy Deluxe Chicken Sandwich (4/5): These are good. Can't complain much, but they're not as spicy as when they initially arrived on the menu.

Grilled Chicken Melt Platter (3/5): I went for the healthy option and wanted to try this. It's very greasy once you eat it.

Mac & Cheese (2/5): The cheese was lacking. It was like eating watered down mac & cheese. I'd pass on this.

Sweet Potato Souffle (2/5): Too, too sweet. Barely touched.

Carrot & Raisin Salad (2/5): I've experienced better. Flavor was lacking. Luby's salad is delicious.

Cole Slaw (2/5): I've experienced better. Flavor was lacking. The BBQ joints have better slaw than this.

Our server was very friendly. Our water did touch bottom though. I do recommend sitting in the diner to try other items featured in ""Little Dwarf House"" (prior to becoming Chick-fil-A).

Would I come back? Well.... I never was a big Chick-fil-A fan. I love the Chick-fil-A sauce, but I never go out of my way to eat Chick-fil-A.",0.2748611111111111,Positive

If you think your getting a southern dinner, think again. The chicken and waffle you can not beat but the southern sides taste like school lunch on fridays . The yams are actually a mashed sweet potato casserole and if your a food connoisseur like myself you can tell they doused the yams with heavy cream, way too creamy for me. Mac and cheese ,eh. But hey! It's a fast food chain restaurant so it's good fora something quick or just a bomb axx chicken sandwich or whatever your craving at the time. You actually won't be disappointed.

1335,Chick-fil-A,1.0,"I never thought in a million years I would give Chickfila anything less than 10 stars. I LOVE Chickfila! They could never do wrong in my eyes... until tonight that is.  I decided to visit the dwarf house tonight and it just did not live up to the typical chickfila standards. For one, the service was not good. The girl who took our order was not friendly. She didn't smile at all. She was super dry and we thought that maybe she was having a bad day so we tried to make a joke with her and she was not here for it. She continued to look at us crazy and said ""I'm just waiting for you to order"". She proceeded to ring us up, give our total and left the register. Another employee had to come finish the transaction because she started doing other things. I have no idea what the attitude was about. I wish I had gotten her name. It started with a Z and she had blonde and black braids. 

The other issue was the food. It just wasn't good. The fries were cold. The grilled nuggets and classic chicken sandwiches just didn't taste good at all. Overall I wont be back. For that to be the ""original"" it does not give a good representation of the chickfila standard that the company prides themselves for.

1336,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"The Dwarf House in Hapeville is an institution.  Hapeville prides itself on being the home of the original Chick-Fil-A.

I doubt there's anything on their menu I have not had.  Growing up in Hapeville, we either had takeout or dined-in at least once, sometimes twice a week.  In high school, this place was the hangout for us all to meet up after our dates.

The drive-through options are minimal compared to the dine-in menu, but those with an addiction to Chick-fil-a don't seem to mind.  The place gets so crowded during lunch that a cop has to direct traffic going in and out of the restaurant's parking lot on weekdays.

The atmosphere is nothing fancy--a diner feel with an animated moving dwarf picture on the back wall showing the seven dwarves going in and out of the coal mine.  As a kid, this intrigued me for hours.  I still get excited when I see the picture--ahhh memories.  Most of the waitresses and managers have been working there for many, many years and know their customers on a first-name and favorite dish basis.  I always like to see the number of years serving on my waitress' name tag--it's usually upwards of 15 years. 

Some of my favorites here are the Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich (fried chicken breast between a buttery bun with a few pickles) chicken biscuits, gravy, coleslaw and hot browns.  For dessert--mmmmmmm, the apple pie, peach pie or chocolate icebox pies are great.  They also have the best soft-serve ice cream EVER.  Therefore, their hand-spun milkshakes will make you think you've died and gone to heaven.

If you come to Atlanta, especially to the airport area, visit the original Chick-fil-a.

I took away one star because their chicken biscuits have gotten smaller over the years.  Other than that, I don't know what I would do without Chick-fil-a, and I think many people can agree.",0.11939999999999998,Positive
1337,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I have visited this location two separate times and did not realize this was the original location for Chick-Fil-A. On both visits, I went into the walk-up counter side and took my food to go. 

I have not ever rated a Chick-Fil-A location with less than 5 Stars as the service has always been exemplary at each site. My first issue was with the parking, it is very tight and on both occasions, I had to circle the lot numerous times to find somebody leaving to get a space. 

Inside the place was packed, I was able to use the restroom to wash my hands and then ordered at the counter and ate inside my car since there were no tables open for indoor seating. This is a very busy location and like all other Chick-Fil-A's the service was very fast and efficient with 100% order accuracy. The spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries were on point as always. 

I would like to return and try the Diner side when back in the area. 

One negative, on both my visits I was approached by several street people who were begging for money. They met me as soon as I got out of my car and as I tried to get back inside. There was also somebody up on the sidewalk outside the door. It can make your visit slightly intimidating.

The other menu items exist just to satisfy the 10% of the population that won't eat chicken sandwiches, breakfast biscuits and sweet tea. And as for being closed Sundays, although that seems just plain weird in this day and age of full service, it's kind of like discovering your good friend doesn't watch TV or listen to the radio. However, weird or misguided you think they are, you accept it (even if they do have unexpectedly high moral standards that make you question your own).

I have been in at all times of day breakfast, lunch and random times in between. The lines never to long of a wait the food usually comes out super fast, though I will say I don't get anything to fancy.

So the coolest things about this location is that it has a private conference room in it that you may are may not have to reserve. most of the time I have been in at lunch people are having a meeting in it. They also have a double drive thru. Not just two lines Two windows too. Which is super cool how the food comes over on this little thing.

For breakfast (not that I'm up this early):  Chicken biscuit.  Don't ask, just enjoy.

Food: classic chicken sandwich or the nugget meal. Are usually likely to accompany this with a large fry and Hi-C fruit punch and lemonade mix.

1370,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"My five star rating is based on the fact that this is a fast food chain, so as far as fast food goes, this is as good as it gets!

I've heard the positive buzz about this place since I started traveling south for work a few years ago, but for some reason, have never tried out a Chick-Fil-A until now. All those wasted trips south when I could have been enjoying this goodness, what was I thinking???

I tried the simple chicken sandwich which comes on a butter-toasted bun garnished with pickles. I added mustard myself. They claim to make the original chicken sandwich. While I'm not sure if this is entirely true, I can say that if it is, all those that have come afterwards have failed miserably! The chicken is real, juicy and tasty, I can say enough about how good it is.

I love the waffle fries too, not greasy, nice and crispy and not loaded with salt. I read as well that the chicken nuggets are awesome, so I decided to pig it up and got myself an 8 piece order. I decided to try the Polynesian sauce and the honey barbecue sauce. The Polynesian was forgettable, but the honey barbecue was amazing! I could put this stuff on ice cream and enjoy it!

One neat thing was the fact that they have a person walking around the dining area asking if you'd like a refill on your drink or to remove your tray. A nice little touch I've never seen before in a fast food restaurant.

I wish we had this chain in the Northeast, so imagine my excitement when I heard that there is a store located in the Burlington Mall in Burlington, MA. I guess I will be heading to the mall sometime soon to get my fix on.",0.09517045454545454,Positive

What did I find?  The dining room was essentially empty, and they were moving slow as fucking turtles in there. Way to uphold the Chick-Fil-A standards there, guys.

Also, I tried the spicy chicken sandwich, and while it was good (I knew it wouldn't be BAD), I still prefer the regular Chick-Fil-A sandwich over it. And it's not spicy.  It tastes different, but not exactly what I would call spicy different. 

I still give it three stars, because, let's face it: it's yummy. And I still like Chick-Fil-A in general.  I was just not impressed with this location at all.",-0.007692307692307682,Neutral
1374,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"In light of recent statements made by Dan Cathy (President and COO of Chick-fil-A) that have sparked controversy, I have to admit that I love Chick-fil-A.  I realize that even the simple act of writing this review may cause some frustration/anger/hate from some Yelpers, so let's just leave it at that...

After checking out some apartments close by on a Saturday afternoon, my siblings and I decided to stop at this Chick-fil-A for a quick lunch.  It was around 3 pm, so the lunch rush was obviously over and the restaurant was pretty dead.  There were maybe two or three other customers aside from us.  

Since it was so quiet, I thought it was odd that there were at least five employees behind the counter.  I guess it's their usual Saturday staff, but they seemed to be joking and playing around instead of focusing on their job.  (Perhaps this has something to do with the aforementioned controversy?)

I ordered a Spicy Chicken sandwich (no pickles!) meal with waffle fries and a Diet Dr. Pepper.  (I LOVE that Chick-fil-A restaurants have Diet Dr. Pepper!  My 2nd favorite drink only after Coke Zero.)  The employees were friendly enough and our food was served quickly.  However, as snooty as this may sound, I noticed that the employee who handed me my drink didn't bother to wipe the sides of the cup where soda had spilled over.  (Note:  They normally DO this!  Even most other fast food restaurants do it!)  That was the first thing that bugged me.

As we walked around to decide where to sit, we noticed that many of the tables didn't look clean.  They probably hadn't wiped anything down since that morning.  We finally chose a booth table to sit at, but there were crumbs on the seat, too.  Annoying.

When we opened up our sandwiches to dig in, we all agreed that it looked like the chicken fillet had gotten flatter/thinner over the past year or so that we have dined at Chick-fil-A.  I recall when the Spicy Chicken sandwich was first introduced at Chick-fil-A about two years ago, the chicken fillet was LARGE and I was super stuffed by the time I finished.  This time around, however, I was disappointed that the size and quality of the chicken seems to have declined.  Not cool.

Similar to the dining area, the women's restroom looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in HOURS.  The trash bin for paper towels was OVERFLOWING.  With so many employees during a very quiet time of the day, this was unacceptable.  I did, however, appreciate the complimentary mouth wash and tiny disposable cups above the sink.

Overall, this Chick-fil-A gets 2.5 stars because it is just not up to par with other Chick-fil-A restaurants, especially the awesome ones I've gotten used to up in Buford.  Hopefully management will become aware of these issues (I highly doubt it was an anomaly) and work to ensure their employees actually do their jobs and at least act like they care.

We were staying at near by hotel and was happy to see that this fairly new location opened up which was so perfect.  I really like this location but depending on where we are @ in Oregon, we will go to one that is convenient. I am happy there are more Chick Fil A locations.  Observing the parking lot, drive thru line, line at restaurant and the huge crowd dining at restaurant, I can see how popular and how much we all love Chick-Fil-A. The line to order was long as me and my daughter were waiting to order and all tables were occupied, we found an empty table as we got close to the line. I really enjoyed and love the spicy chicken sandwich along with the fries and different sauces. Our orders were deluxe combo, with (limited time) strawberry lemonade drink, spicy sandwich and another large waffle fries. Although the lines were long, it moved quick and we got our orders quick. My daughter and I enjoyed our Chick Fil A sandwich and had fun dipping our fries with the different sauce. Our favorites are the Polynesian, Chick Fil A sauce and sweet and spicy sriracha. 

I really love the added succulents plants on the table and as I left I noticed the community table, which is perfect for dining with a big crowd of family/friends or even for a meeting. Check out the community table as it was made by materials salvaged from unwanted and abandoned homes and the hands that built it belong to a person who also once felt unwanted and abandoned.

1385,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"Made my second visit here last night.  Based on the Waffle Fries being ""mushy"" the first time, I specifically requested that they be left in an extra 15 seconds, so they would be cooked and crispy.  That was acknowledged, and when my order was brought to me, the guy mentioned that the Waffle Fries were ""well done.""  Sadly, they were not - just as soft and mushy as the first time.  Maybe Chick-fil-A is trying to save wear & tear on the oil in the fryer?

Grilled Chicken Sandwich was pretty good, but if they can't get the fries crispy, I see no need to go back.  Also, the parking lot is a disaster - obstacles everywhere - and there is no way to get out without having to make an illegal turn around the barrier in the middle of the street.

I grabbed 2 no pickle chicken sandwiches, handed it to her, she just looked at the sandwiches then asked me ""are you sure that it's the right sandwich you want"" I literally went dumb and said 'huh?' She pointed out that it was no pickle, at first I thought she was just trying to help me out thinking I grabbed the wrong one. But when I explained it is the one I want and she still didn't take the sandwich from my hand I was confused.

Then she looks at my son and asks if I was military. I said 'no' she then asks me if my husband is military, I said 'no' then she sighs and asks me is anyone in my family I said 'yes, my brother'... again the sandwiches are still in my hand.

After all of that, I didn't even get a discount and my chicken sandwich was extra dry. No comparison to the real deal of a restaurant.

Upon walking all the way back to Chick-fil-A, which was far from my gate, I returned the sandwich for a re-make. Luckily, I saw the pickles prior to biting into the sandwich--for I am allergic.

It still tasted like the chicken sandwich and fries he loves, but that's where the good review ends. I asked him how many stars would you like me to give and he said 2 stars for horrible service. He said it's unusual to go to a Chick-fil-a where they don't give great service so when he encountered the rude employees here he felt Chick-fil-a and people in general should know. He said there was no smiling and any of the niceness that the restaurant is known for. Also, when his food was ready the young lady who had his food in her hand didn't call his name, waited for him to approach her (even though he was standing right there), and when he did approach her about his food, she didn't look at him at all. She handed him his food as if he waa bothering her. He's a nice guy, so he didn't say anything to them directly, but he said this experience encouraged him to start being more vocal about bad service (and great service) while he is still at an establishment. Now I always try to give the benefit of the doubt and I thought maybe this one is different because it's located in the busiest airport. Therefore, they were probably having a long frustrating day, but no, that is not an excuse. This is because I ordered food from another restaurant and they were as nice as can be.

(+) Usual good, tasty food I have come to expect from CFA. We were not very hungry after getting off the plane, but had a chicken sandwich anyways since we can't get this back home in Vegas(yet!)
(+) prices weren't too bad for being located inside an airport! 2 sandwiches, 1 order of waffle fries, and 1 drink was around $11. Not bad at all.
(+) Live piano player in the food court area. lol Maybe that should be credited to the airport more than CFA though.

The waffle fries are amazing. Be sure to get Polynesian sauce for dipping the sandwich, nuggets, and fries in!

Tip: Instead of getting the meal, order the entree and the hash browns or fries separately and don't get the drink. It's cheaper!

A minor point; there isn't a self service drink station. So, anytime you want a refill you have to bother an employee. A small annoyance. WiFi is available. Don't forget they're closed on Sundays. 

It's fast food, but I was impressed with the number of fairly healthy options. Grilled chicken sandwiches, salads, and grilled chicken tenders along with the traditional fried versions. I opted for the grilled chicken sandwich (about $4.50). A wheat bun (gluten free available for $1.50 more), large chicken breast, lettuce, and tomato. This was an excellent choice. Perfectly and simply prepared juicy chicken perfectly complemented by the cool lettuce and tomato without any heavy sauces. Outstanding! Combo meals are of course available and served with their awesome waffle fries (or a selection of healthier choices). Indulge in the fries once in a while, though. Crispy outside and fluffy inside without being greasy.

Ambiance
The inside is all clean and new, and it has a modern (dare I even say upscale) interior. There is a small children's play area and of course a drive thru. 

Service
Everyone was quite friendly inside, and there was almost no line at noon on a weekday (there was a bit of a drive thru line). When I received my order and said thank you the employee said ""my pleasure"" which is always such a classy response more akin to a high end hotel or restaurant. 

Food
Two words - waffle fries. Try these!  They are very, very good. Crispy outside with a fluffy potato interior. The chicken sandwich had a good sized juicy fried chicken breast with a mildly crunchy coating as well as a few pickles. Personally I like this simplicity without heavy sauces or cheese. Their coatings (on sandwiches and nuggets) tend to be ""wetter"" and a bit less of a ""dry"" type of crunchy than their competitors. The sandwich itself runs about $3.50, but I had a free meal card they had been mailing out to generate business for their new location. Check your mail for these!  They give you one free item a month for February, March, and April. Overall their food is definitely higher quality when compared to other fast food venues.

The food came very quick and we had a decently large order.  We ordered two number 2 entree onlys, a 4 piece chicken strip entree, and a large waffle fries.  The chicken sandwiches were good, tasty, crispy.  The strips had a good batter to it, and they have a nice variety of dipping sauces.

1455,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I have great excitement building for Monday's Chic-Fil-A Spicy Chicken sandwich launch. I usually only get this excited when McD rolls out the Shamrock and McRib combo each spring. Burger King has been trying to seduce me with a rib on an actual bone, but there's no chance I touch those. Honestly has anyone ever seen a BK with a health score above 80? I can't do BK. If feels like having to use the loo at a Marshalls. No thank you, I'll squeeze the cheeks and wait it out. 

So CFA is plastering a marketing campaign (sans cows?!?) all over ESPN this week with the the following description about their new Spicy Chicken sandwich... ""Tastes like a chicken got jumped by a pepper factory, inside a volcano, on the surface of the sun."" 

Really... that spicy? I hope not because this sandwich has the potential to be my new go-to fast food delicacy, and I would hate to have it be too spicy and go the way of the Garden Whopper. Remember those? Didn't think so, they were terrible. 

Granted I am of Scandinavian decent, no latin in me (unfortunately - I'd love to have an omnipresent tan and be able to roll my R's with reason.) Still I do enjoy spicy food. I'll do some jalepenos at a Mexican joint, or General Zhao chicken, or even some Tandori chicken. So call me slightly above middle of the road Yanks in ability to handle and affinity for spicy food. CFA, if the new sandwich is too spicy for me, it will be too spicy for America. And you don't want that. We want an alternative to the current best fast food spicy chicken option, the belt currently hangs on Wendy's waist.

CFA execs I know you read my FB page, so let me help explain where you need to spice this thing in the best way I can; Latina Levels of Spicy

Minimalist Spice, or the Catherine Zeta Jones.
Catherine Zeta Jones sounds like she'd be Latino. She's perhaps best known for her roles in the Zoro series where she plays a Mexican. But Zeta Jones is actually Welsh! Who knew?!? Similarly the sandwiches here are not much different than the regular chicken sandwiches on the menu. They may dust it with some paprika and charge an extra buck for it. McDonald's offering is here. No different than the original, so very skippable.

Mid Spice, or the Selena Gomez.
Definitely latin so there is some inherent spice; but still on Disney Channel so very PG. This is a good place for CFA to spice their sandwich. Ideally they land it here and I'd be all over it. Popeye's spicy chicken is at this level. Too bad Popeye's doesn't understand how to run a drive thru or I'd go there more often. I can pluck my own chicken in the time it takes to get those lard and butter biscuit beauties out the window and into my car. A shame really. CFA - this is your sweet spot.

Dang Spicy, or the Penelope Cruz
Very latin, slightly crazy, and deducting huge points for being with Tom Cruz who is justifiably insane (although I will see his summer movie with Cameron Diaz, great casting for Tom, but he's still crazy.) Wendy's current champ in the spicy chicken sandwich category is here, and it's my favorite option. But every time I enjoy one I do have to dab the forehead after each bite. And when you spend as much time as I do prepping my Scandinavian pale skin for forays into public, I can't be dabbing off moisturizer and suntan lotion. Just a bit too spicy but still a nice option.

Dangerously Over Spiced, of the Dominican Woman
Forgive the title, I don't really mean to throw all Dominican women into this category. Truthfully I only know one. She's the wife of a guy I work with. When first meeting her at a company function, her husband leans over and in all seriousness says... ""careful, she may look sweet but she's Dominican, she'll pull a knife on ya!"" No smile on his face. Completely serious. And by the end of the night, I could see the crazy coming out of this woman's ears. No knives were pulled, but I stayed on the other side of the dinner table. You can only get a fast food option this spicy at an authentic Mexican drive thru place. The kind of place where the menu is in Spanish and they only take cash. But if you want a super spicy anything, this is your place. 

When Monday's lunch comes and I hike it over to CFA and get my waffle fries, sweet tea and new spicy sandwich; please CFA, make it a Selena Gomez and not a Dominican jumped by a pepper mill on the face of the sun... everyone knows if you jump a Dominican they pull their knives. And this is just fast food, no blood needs to be spilled.

I walked over to this spot today as it was such a nice day. This Chick Fil A is located at the Terminus building where such other places like Lola Bellini, Aquaknox, Bricktops and Flying Biscuit. I would think this place attracts more of the office crowd during lunch time. The place is smaller than the conventional restaurant and they have a pretty large patio area. 

The interior of the resturant gets an A+ because of the cleanliness. Secondly, it's get's a A+ in customer service, the clerk (she was an area director) was extremely friendly, charming and she actually brought out my meal. You can tell their number one mission is customer satisfaction and I can see (at least at this location) they are serious aboutAt The Terminus Building.

I had the grilled chicken sandwich, with the waffle fries and coke zero. The waffle fries were as good as always and the sandwich was decent. Unfortunately the grilled breast was a little on the small side and the bun, which wasn't bad, was a little over-bearing. Other than that; it was a decent meal and the quality overall was very good.

Holy Cow, really?!
My wife specifically asked when ordering for 4 salad dressings to go with our 2 salads.  When the guy brought it out of the back kitchen she asked again specifically if they were in there, he said yes (she glanced in and saw at least 2).  Well, you know where this is going,... there were only the 2 dressings in there (so, I had to walk back to my wife's work building to get 1, and use up even more of my lunchtime).

I like their buffalo sauce & srachia (wrong spelling lol.) I also love their milk shakes which are similar to Burger King's. I recommend to download their app as it is easy to use, add money to and order ahead if needed. With the app you earn rewards for free menu items. I also go as far as taking the survey that comes sometimes on the bottom of the receipt that gets you a free chicken sandwich! Why not? Takes 5 minutes. Service is really friendly here.

1480,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"Let me preface by saying I am a huge Chick-fil-A fan and due to the unfortunate fact that there isn't one in Cambridge/Boston, I exclusively drive 30 minutes to get my spicy chicken deluxe here. Whenever I go on a road trip, Chick-fil-A is where I get breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I have visited many locations and this one is objectively the worst in service quality.

Well, the service would be acceptable if this were Taco Bell or McDonald's but because Chick-fil-A is renowned for its excellent service, this location is a disappointment. 

I have had my order messed up on three separate occasions with all orders placed via the mobile app, which makes it even less excusable. If any employee at this location paid even the slightest bit of attention, someone would have noticed that an entire box of chicken nugget was missing, a chicken filet (they even printed the correct label for it on the box) became a chicken sandwich, or the fork that I requested was nowhere in the bag. You know what's even worse? Water cups without straws. How can something so routine that it should be muscle memory at this point be messed up? How do you work the drive-through for more than 30 minutes and not automatically include a straw for every drink you hand over? 

I normally would let this slide but because they closed dine-in due to COVID-19, we had to do curbside pickup. The whole point is to avoid contact and interaction as much as possible but because I paid for my damn chicken nuggets, I had to drive back, get out of my car, risk infecting you / getting infected myself to ask for my paid chicken nuggets. The employee seemed nonchalant about this whole situation and didn't apologize for screwing this up probably because they messed up so much that they are desensitized to it.

I believe what I experienced is just a symptom of a bigger underlying problem of hiring unmotivated workers who do not care about what Chick-fil-A stands for. In this world where poor service and shaky values are ubiquitous, Chick-fil-A is a beacon that attracts customers for its delicious food, solid values, and more importantly, quality service. It's one of the few restaurants, accessible to all economic classes, where you can expect to be treated with respect, courtesy, and care. By those metrics, this location is an utter failure and only tarnishes the name that the other locations uphold. 

I was going to give this location a one star rating. However, the food that I did get is still delicious, perhaps more of a testament to Chick-fil-A's recipe rather than this location's ability to run a successful franchise so I will add one additional star.

1492,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"The Chick-fil-A at Cobb Parkway and Akers Mill is drive-thru only.  This location has a triple drive-thru.

Drivers in:
Drive-thru Lane #1 pick up food on the passenger side.
Drive-thru Lane #2 pick up food on the driver side.
Drive-thru Lane #3 pick up food on the driver side.

All lanes are staffed by CFA employees.  Lanes 1 and 2 are connected directly to the kitchen.  Lane 3 receives orders via a conveyor system.  The menus and ordering stations are semi-covered, so you won't get as wet when it rains.

If you're traveling alone, I'd recommend lanes 2 or 3 for convenience's sake.  I took lane 1 one time and the CFA employee was waiting for me, sitting on the window ledge, when I pulled up.  Her sitting on the ledge maximized her length of reach into my car.  Great service is consistent across virtually all Chick-fil-A's, including this drive-thru.

In addition to the drive-thru, there are two walk-up windows, so you can park your car at the Chipotle next door and walk over.  There are a few tables with umbrellas on the small sidewalk outside.  I wouldn't eat there during a peak time, though, because you'd constantly have idling automobiles and all their fumes flanking you on either side.

The food is just as good as the standalone stores.  My favorites continue to be the classic Chicken Sandwich and Spicy Chicken Sandwich and their perfectly sweet Sweet Tea.  Be sure to ask for extra napkins and any condiments you'd like on the way out.  CFA has six sauces you can choose from: BBQ, Buffalo, Buttermilk Ranch, Chick-fil-A, Honey Mustard, and Polynesian.

The cashier was awesome and I truly appreciate that. The bagger and/or runner was not that nice. I assumed that the grilled chicken sandwich automatically came with honey roasted BBQ. When I saw that it was missing I inquired about it. She stated that it doesn't and that I have to ask for it. In addition, I could tell she was flustered and rushed which she did not hide with her demeanor. I ordered a 8ct grilled nugget and only received 6.

Today I ordered a bowl of soup. I work less than five minutes away and when I get back to my desk the soup was cold and to top it off the three packs of crackers in my bag were all crushed up! I went last week and ordered a spicy chicken sandwich. I could tell there was some confusion going on but I looked in the bag before driving off and everything looked accurate. I get to work and the sandwich had no pickles!!! So I know I got the person's order behind me. The fries were just plain out inedible. Disgustingly cold and burnt. There's nothing like waiting in line for over 30 mins to discover four extra crispy, pinky sized chicken tenders. Seriously!!??I never get a pleasurable experience here and they always seem to let me down even when I say let me give them a fifteenth chance. I thought maybe it's the lane that I'm choosing! I usually do the third lane because it's easier and my salads would just look like crap. No matter what lane the salads are the same looking. The lettuce is usually old and they are so skimpy in comparison to other Chick-fil-A's. No more will I continue with these horrible experiences from here. Get it together!!

On 8-12-2019 they had just opened up the drive thru since they open up at 6:30am. I had order a bacon, egg and cheese meal with (extra bacon) WELL DONE, with the hashbrowns/orange juice. I was told that they no longer can make food well done, and that corporate changed that. I was told to drive around to speak with the manager YOSSI, and when the manager came to a window he said had a attitude as well! He threw up his hands walking to the window, and SAID (WHAT NOW) VERY LOUDLY?! I asked him about the new policy, and he said they can no longer cook food well done. So I said that, I would just order the sausage egg and cheese meal and I wanted the chicken egg white sandwich. Joy (JOANNE) got a nasty attitude, huffed/puffed then told me what else in a nasty tone? When I got my order IT WAS THE WRONG CHICKEN SANDWICH with (only a grilled piece of chicken, on a dry biscuit). I drove back around to the window, and when Joy saw me she rolled her eyes, and asked WHAT? IN A NASTY TONE! I told her my food was incorrect again. She then took the sandwich had them put a cold piece of cheese on the sandwich. I looked at it, and told her they where suppose to have re made my sandwich. Also, it was the incorrect sandwich, and she got a attitude again. I asked for the manager YOSSI again, and he came to the window. I complained about my food being incorrect, and my order always being incorrect. I also complained about joys nasty attitude, and how she is very prejudice being that I'm African American. I told him I've never had a horrible experience like this ever at a chik fi li restaurant, and she do not need to be working for this company. She is a horrible representative for this corporation and he just knodded his head then walked off not saying anything. Then Joy came back to the window with ANOTHER SANDWICH that look like it was put in the microwave with a SUPER HARD BISCUIT. AGAIN! The sandwich was NOT A EGG WHITE GRILL SANDWICH it was STILL THE GRILLED CHICKEN ON A DRY BISCUIT! The manager YOSHI do not care about the customer service, he is unprofessional, have a nasty attitude, and does not know how to interact with customers. Joy is very rude, have a nasty attitude, unprofessional, and DO NOT NEED TO BE WORKING FOR THIS FRANCHISE.

1502,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"I was finally able to eat here last week. I used the drive-thru as there was no way I wanted to park in the Target lot and wait in a line a mile long. The drive thru was packed also, but was moving quickly.

I ordered the chicken deluxe sandwich meal (sandwich, fries, and soda). The employees were extremely pleasant and helped me with my order, as I had never been to a Chick-fil-A before. I got through the drive-thru in less than 15 minutes and arrived home 5 minutes later.

When I got home the food was still warm and the Coke was delicious, I mean really delicious. It tasted like the bottled stuff from Mexico. Unfortunately the fries were VERY dry and tasteless and only made marginally better with the fry sauce (keep in mind these are not normal fries they are waffle fries). The chicken sandwich should be the star of the show, but it was a little dry and kind of tasteless. You can tell the chicken in the sandwich is quality breast, but if you cook it too long it becomes dry and tasteless. 

I will give them another try someday, but I think it won't be for awhile as the wait is just too long right now. Maybe after the hype dies down I can eat inside to see if it tastes better right out of the deep fryer.

I know its not good for business but I'm glad it slowed down a little so its not a half mile long line in the drive through anymore.

They also have a huge amount of sauces and they ask you what you'd like, I asked for 2 of everything. I definitely recommend the chick-fil-a sauce and the Polynesian sauce as well. I had the original chicken sandwich and it was super moist and tasty! There just pickles on it, what I found amazing is that they made a chicken sandwich tasty without a sauce on it, just a bun, chicken, and a few pickles. Their waffle fries are also delicious!

I've had chick fil a before being from Texas so the arrival, although just as exciting, was not as blindsiding as it was to others. I waited about a week after the first opening, because I did not want to wait in that ridiculously long line. Once I did go the line was still long, but the efficiency that they had was unbelievable-- I was super impressed. There were two lines (in the drive thru) and had multiple ""stations"" where you'd first get a menu, the next you'd get your order taken, the next you'd get your sauces, the next you'd pay, and at the last you'd get your food. All in all your trip would only max out to be about 15 minutes in line, which I thought was amazing for only being open for a week. After being open for a few weeks they took the ""stations"" away, but still have high efficiency even though the popularity is still there, and I don't think it takes too long to get through the line. 

Onto the actual good part, the food: over the years I've had the chicken strips, chicken nuggets, and the deluxe chicken sandwich and I have to say the deluxe chicken sandwich is my favorite. The waffle fries are amazing, cause duh, waffle fries. You don't even need dipping sauce with them, but if you do, chik fil a sauce should be your sauce of choice. The lemonade is thirst quenchingly good and I've heard the ice tea is phenomenal, but I wouldn't know personally, cause I hate tea.

I got a parking spot in front of the door and had about a 3-5 minute wait in line.  Despite having ordered everything custom (spicy chicken sandwich with extra pickles and waffle fries with no salt), the food came out quickly and it was hot and just like i had in Arizona a couple weeks ago.  

The restaurant gets mobbed.  When i left there was a line out the door.  They have someone directing traffic near the entrance and there was a bike cop nearby (not sure if he was there to help or give out traffic tickets).  They have tons of people working there for the opening and several people asked if they could get me anything else.  My only complaint is that all Chickfila stores should carry Tabasco sauce.

This glorification is insane and overly dramatic. 

Lets talk about more poetic nonsense and bull here. 

Maybe I should pray to whoever that may the servers be not polite and have sharp snark like their urban counterparts. How we can wish that they will stop showering and grow a facial hair and change their overall shirt colors to  black and alter their uniforms to ""Goodwill"" chic. 

I also wish that they can spare one of their chickens to join the Lents Chicken Beauty pageant for summer (when it is available cause it is a thing to witness). If the POTUS can pardon one turkey for Thanksgiving, I'm sure Chick Fil A can pardon one hen to join a pageant. 

In all seriousness, if you see that the drive through line is long, park and go inside. Their take out system flows so smooth and fast. Plus you won't feel guilty devouring your food cause you already burned some calories walking and opening the door. There is ample parking space. 

The chicken itself is decent. It is chicken unlike other fast-food joints where you'll have second thoughts if what you're really chewing is chicken. For texture, it does feel like it's chicken. For taste, it is as bland as a chicken raised in a farm in the midwest.

In all honesty, I would give this place a 2.5 out of 5 but I can't, so I rounded up since the service was good.",0.12320833333333332,Positive

It's like they don't really know what a Chick-Fil-A sandwich tastes like - I lived in TX for 5 years, so I do know.  The seasoning is a little off; it's not quite cooked correctly, either.  If you just want a chicken sandwich, it's OK.  If you want a real Chick-Fil-A sandwich, go to Georgia or Texas, or even Illinois.

1534,Chick-fil-A,1.0,"I tried, really. The idea of a fast food chicken sandwich that's actually good is an enticing idea. Once in a while, it's ok, but I have had three poor experiences in six since they opened and really, that's pathetic. I don't think I'll try number seven.

The first time, I had a terrible sandwich - it was just bad. I responded to their ask for a review in their app and I was sent a couple cards for free sandwiches, but it took a long time for me to bother to return. 

When I did return (this is the second time), I tried to use the cards but that turned into a fiasco because the entire order had to be rebuilt because the cashier didn't know how to use the cards. I spent 15 minutes placing an order for two meals. Silly. The order ended up being wrong.

The third time, a few days ago, we ordered three meals for carry-out. We left with one incorrect sandwich (that could not be eaten) and two extra orders of fries that we didn't order but were charged for, anyway. All of that was literally crammed into two bags that were over full and could not be closed, so guess what? Cold incorrect orders. (But hey, at least they saved the cost of a bag, right?) The kids ate and I had a lot of cold fries. The best part is that notifying the location and the corporate office did nothing at all - no response from either. I know, it's fast food, but if an order is wrong, it's just wrong.

We tried chicken sandwiches,  the toasted bun is nice and the chicken is tender and delicious!

1539,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"Make no mistake, for fast food, in the region, Chick-fil-A is home to the *best* fried chicken sandwich around.  Having said that, in terms of all fried chicken sandwiches on the planet, it's merely ""fine"".

I remember CFA from many, many years ago at Clackamas Town Center.  They occupied the corner space, above the skating rink, and down from the arcade.  They'd often be handing out nugget samples, and I enjoyed more than a few.  Super tasty!  I didn't really lament their departure, or really even notice for that matter.  It wasn't until years later, and the same-sex marriage controversy with the chain, that I remembered they even existed.

Obviously their grand opening was an ""event"".  Initially I visited the store a few weeks after it opened, and was greeted with 40+ cars in line.  I've only been through the drive-thru.  The line went fast.  Their customer service is top notch, and it's a nice touch that they ask for your name at the beginning of the order.  I think the prices are reasonable for high quality fast food.  So the sandwich, yes, it's very good.  Tasty fried chicken breast, with pickles, on a bun.  That's the standard version.  I recommend the following - upgrade to a multigrain bun.  Omit the pickles.  Add cheese + bacon, and dump the sauce of your choice on the sandwich.  Honey is a good choice, or any of their other sweet sauces (Polynesian, CFA sauce).  Optional: put the waffle fries directly on the sandwich as well.  I've had their nuggets too, and while tasty, they're tiny.  If you're going this route, get 12, and not 8.  You'll be able to finish them, I assure you.  For a drink, I like to go with an Arnold Palmer (with unsweetened tea).

So yeah, it's good for fast food.  It's only something I'll make an effort to visit a few times a year, though.  Don't let the lines intimidate you, they go quickly.",0.2361616161616162,Positive

First, I was very impressed by the staff and surprised.  Majority of them were just teenagers, but they had a best customer service I have seen in awhile, so my hat's off to them.

However, the food didn't favor as well.  I tried the fried chicken sandwich meal with fries.  The sandwich was a bit too thick and chewing was a workout.  Also, the fries were not crispy and had a weird texture because they are cross cut and not traditional type french fries. 

I do like that they have a wide selection of sauces and that they don't give you grief on asking for multiple types and quantities.

No lines inside but the drive thru was quite long. I was going to do 2 separate orders but as everything comes in a bag, one order it was- one CFA sandwich meal and two separate 
CFA sandwiches, without pickles. Oh, all seven sauces (totally forgot the cheese sauce until after!) The order was called back and I waited a few minutes before another employee brought my order and repeated the order. 

The sandwiches without pickles were clearly marked and the fries were hot. The sandwich was perfect, never seen such a perfect bun and warm chicken! It was fun trying all the sauces- some were too watery and salty but I kept going back to the garlic & herb ranch (I normally do not like ranch), which was a nice balance. The half tea, half lemonade was great too, really nice and refreshing. 

With a casual atmosphere and food kept simple plus done right as well as friendly employees, I see the obsession! The soft instrumental praise music was subtle and the motion detected trash disposal were all perks, but a little steep I thought. For a meal it was a little over 7.50 and one CFA sandwich came out to be over 4. Maybe I haven't had fast food in a while but thought it was a tad more than what I used to pay.

As for the remainder of the ""meal"" (?)  the soda; well, it's hard to screw up Dr. Pepper as far as the ""FAMOUS SIGNATURE"" basket fries they were unsalted, under cooked, cold tasteless and quickly fed to the nearest refuse receptacle!

East side? West Side? Which one is better? Location-wise, I prefer this one. It's easier to get to from the highway, has better access and parking, and it's quite a bit larger. 

Food wise, it's pretty much the same. The menu and pricing is exactly the same. The service is good at both as well. They are both fast and or slow depending on the hour and traffic. This location has been open just a couple of weeks longer, so you wont gain anything from more experienced employees. 

I've taken quite a few friends and family members here, and every single one has remarked, and I've notice myself, that for a brand new establishment, they have REALLY got this grand opening thing down. Anyone who wants to learn about starting a business or crowd control needs to check out a Chick Fil A opening. No matter how crowded they are, or how long the wait, they keep the flow going at a steady pace, without taking any shortcuts. 

I've been here more than a dozen times (yikes! that's a lot since they've not even been open a few months.)

I came on grand opening day, although I did have to work, so by the time I arrived the lines were very VERY long. The drive thru line was stretched behind Target, but we parked and walked over. The line to eat in wrapped around the parking lot. It took about an hour to get in. 

I still haven't gotten around to trying everything on the menu, but I started out with the regular chicken sandwich, which is good. It's better with mayo or sauce. I like it with the chick fil a sauce. Hubby gets a spicy one and add buffalo. My favorite is the chicken wrap. I like the buttermilk ranch better than the garlic. Next time I will try the BBQ. 

I really like that they have Diet Lemonade,but I wish they sweetened it with stevia instead of artificial sweeteners.

I didn't expect the food to be as good as it was back home, but it might actually be better! The fries were just right in freshness and didn't have that artificial aftertaste I get from places like Mickey Ds. The Deluxe Chicken Sandwich was just heaven, and at the end there was that crunchy breading I'd missed so much. Costs a little more than the other chains nearby (around $7 for a meal), but it's worth it. To say they are below Taco Bell or McDonald's is a crock, but I guess if you like your ""meat"" to come from mysterious substances that were probably glued together in a lab, then yeah, Chik Fil A isn't for you!

I'd like to also mention that opening day staff were awesome, they're still giving out prizes and the owner was even out amongst the crowd greeting and taking pictures with folks.

My first impression, riding up, and seeing a queue of 10cars, x 2 lanes, makes you want to kick the wheel to the right and ""elevate"" out of the theater of combat-you know: live another day. But they deserve praise. 

Now, kudos on the Lands End corporate coats-makes me want to sport one. 

But let me be serious , many of them with 1 year or less of service, on a busy Saturday, they got my vehicle through the line, in less than 10mins (7.326mins), with enough chicken to feed an entire village.

Spicy chicken sandwich - breading is soft, has no crunch, and the chicken breast tastes like flavorless rubber. The breast was over cooked...each of the 3 times I've gotten it (totally my fault for being duped into coming here 3 times)

Fries - again not crispy, perhaps this is a theme. They were undercooked and would be better revamped in a toaster oven at home.

1577,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"Glad to have this chain make it out to Portland. Sometimes, you're in the mood for a greasy (but perfectly cooked) real fried chicken sandwich and a southern style lemonade or sweet tea. For that, chick fil a delivers. They don't do much, but they do chicken (and sauce) extremely well. Every time I've been here, the chicken has been unbelievably moist and flavorful, the sandwiches piping hot, the fries bountiful, and all the ingredients tasting farm fresh. Despite how amazing the food is, my favorite menu item is, by far, the frosted lemonade. Far too few places combine the flavors of dairy and citrus, and it truly is an excellent pairing. Like a lemonade milkshake, the frosted lemonade is refreshing and light-feeling while also being moderately filling.
I know it's just a chain restaurant, but I have to strongly recommend visiting chick fil a at least once every few months.",0.15039682539682542,Positive

On Saturday May 12, I decided to stop and pick up a 3 Grill Chicken Sandwiches, 1 for myself and 2 for my son. It was 8:30pm and I was very tired because I had been working in my garden at my parents place. I pulled up to the drive thru and employee took my order and said it would be $15.00 and change. I reached for my wallet and noticed I didn't have it with me. I told him not to worry about the order and to cancel it. He said I could go ahead and get my order and that they would give me a ticket and I could return to pay. I drove forward and when my order was brought to me I asked the employee for my receipt and he said not to worry about it. He said that they had treated my order as promotional and I didn't owe anything. I certainly had every intention of returning to pay for my order.

The Spicy Chicken Sandwich Deluxe gave them just what they craved, with crisp and tender bites into the meat, topped with fresh lettuce and tomatoes, cushioned by tasty pickles, and bathed in the honey mustard barbecue sauce that is to die for! 

My taste buds almost fainted from the tangy flavor, but I kept them awake with the hot, fresh waffle fries that were cooked to perfection! The real potato flavor came out with each bite, and that got my tongue's attention.

The nuggets were tasty, even more so with the aforementioned honey mustard barbecue sauce. We also tried the buffalo sauce, but my taste buds kept returning to the mustard euphoria, and from then on, all was lost to the descending food coma.

I explained to Clara what the situation was, and explained to her that I only wanted a refund on the sandwich that had the burned bun and nothing else. Clara then refused and stated it's there policy not to give refunds by any means. Not to mention, she demanded that I removed my car or she would call the police. This was most most embarrassing and awful experience that I'd ever had to experience in my life. Because of their mistake, I was embarrassed, mistreated, and insulted. To add insult to injury, she stated that she was in fact the store manager, so there was no one else to complain to regarding her behavior.

The chicken sandwich smelled really weird and not very hot and after getting home and looking at it in the kitchen light it seemed like it had some old caked up grease on it.

1625,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"The hype of a Chick-fil-A opening in NYC was too real and yet I couldn't convince myself it was worth the trip into the city just for a possibly ridiculous wait just to try the famous chicken.  Fortunately, during my visit to Orlando there was this location right behind my hotel.  Therefore, due to someone's random craving we stopped in and I had my first Chick-fil-A.

First impression: I can understand why people enjoy the southern style chicken served at this chain.  I don't know if the NYC food quality is as good as the southern origins of Chick-fil-A but this place definitely surpassed my expectations.  The regular chicken sandwich was excellent and paired very well with the special sauce.

What I really enjoyed about this location in particular is great customer service; someone came to our table and brought drink refills back to our table for us.

I've been going here for years and the staff is so nice... even when the lines should be long, they get through them fast and they always have people there waiting for the next person.  Everyone greets you and there's always someone in the dining room cleaning up.  One time I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and they gave me the wrong thing, I went back  and they told me they didn't have any ready and wouldn't for a while (transition between breakfast and lunch at the time).  They had accidentally let me order it I guess.  So they apologized and gave me a free coupon to come back for the right sandwich and were incredibly apologetic.

I do especially like this particular restaurant.  Very clean, friendly employees, drive-thru moves really fast even when they are really busy, and the pieces of chicken are nice and large which fill the bun well (I state this because there are some Chick-FIl-A restaurants that have really dinky pieces of chicken.

I've eaten Chick-fil-A before and I always enjoy it, to my surprise though three of my co workers have never tried it before.  Be aware that this location is very busy, drive through line was so long it wrapped around the building so we decided to eat inside.

Once inside we were greeted by the staff and assured that we would be ordering shortly.  The line inside was moving pretty quick and in less than 5 minutes we were ordering our meals.  Everyone ordered either the chicken tenders or the chicken sandwich, with waffles fries and a fountain drink or sweet iced tea.  Our food was brought out to us in about 5-7 minutes and all of our orders were correct, food was steaming hot as well.  Chick-fil-A meals are tasty and the quality of food is far better than the rest of the fast food chains in my opinion.  As for my co-workers who never tried Chick-fil-a before they thoroughly enjoyed the juicy & perfectly seasoned chicken tenders & waffle fries.  We all agreed that they have the best sweet iced tea in the game.

If you're tired of the burger gang fast food chains you can't go wrong eating at Chick-fil-A.

The diet lemonade is downright addictive!!! For a few months, I bought it by the gallon until I came to my senses and realized that was costing me an arm and a leg! 

Thing I'm not so fond of: the creepy joy of the staff. Yes, I know they have to respond to a ""thank you"" with a ""my pleasure!"" but it gets to be a bit much. Or maybe I just say thank you too often. The other thing that I don't like is they're closed on Sundays.

The food was extraordinary, and once again textbook. I had the same meal two days in a row and consistency was there, it looked and tasted the exact same both days. I order their Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich and it looked like the kind of sandwich you see on the front of a magazine, the lettuce perfectly balanced, the tomatoes perfectly placed, the bacon crisscrossing and slightly over extending the edge of the sandwich to show its presence, and the chicken PERFECTLY cooked. Absolutely amazing flavor, all packed into a chicken sandwich that will knock you off your shoes.

I don't eat it often, but when I do, it really needs to be worth the calories. McDonald's fries, a BK Whopper, oh yeah! And how I made it to 63 without trying Chik Fil A, I don't know. I always wanted to try it, and as I was on Sawmill Rd. at lunchtime, ohmigosh, my mouth was watering just thinking about it. The place was jammed and the getting the food out was really slow, but the counter folks were beyond pleasant.

I went with just the classic chicken sandwich and waffle fries, to really get the Chik Fil A experience. Well, this is the sandwich that the word ""meh"" was invented for. The chicken was moist, and satisfyingly greasy, but tasted identical to the moist and greasy bun. As in, zero flavor. The chicken breast was too thick for the minimal crusting that was on it, and it had no seasoning whatsoever. The only thing that had any taste was the one lonely pickle slice in the middle. 

The waffle fries, on the other hand, were positively repulsive. Flabby, pale, raw tasting slices of potato with no detectable crispness. You can achieve the same effect at home with a bag of Ore Ida waffle fries and a microwave. I threw the whole tasteless mess in the trash, along with my $7.

As a 3rd shifter, I crave dinner items when everyone else wants breakfast and it can be hard. 

I walked in and was instantly greeted with a smile and a hello. I let them know I'd need a minute because I was hungry but breakfast didn't sound great to me. The gentleman at the register happily offered to cook me anything I wanted on the menu and told me it may take a few more minutes than usual. I happily agreed and ordered a chicken sandwich meal with pickles on the side.

When it came out, a lady walked it to me and asked me to double check and make sure everything was right. Everything was perfect, they even stamped 'no pickle' on the sandwich bag to ensure it was right. 

The sandwich and waffle fries were so hot and fresh I burnt my mouth a few times. Even the last bite was still hot.

I ordered a kids meal, a grilled chicken sandwich and large fries. Got my order, went home then when I was almost home I realized she never gave me the kids meal drink, I looked and nothing. OK, so I have some apple juice at home, then I noticed my sandwich was very light, found the chicken does not look like it usually does and was thinner than all the other previous times I've ordered this sandwich. Wow, for almost $5.00 I get this flat weird looking piece of chicken which is smaller than the bun. I've never had this problem at the Pflugerville location, won't be returning here, will wait until my location opens again.

1649,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"Chick-Fil-A is probably the only restaurant chain worthy of a 5-star rating (in my book).  I generally have a great experience at each CFA, the food and customer service are always consistently top notch.  

But on this visit it was even more special than the rest.  Today was ""Free Spicy Chicken Sandwich Day"".  They are the only chain I know that always gives back to the public by offering such freebies - - the Spicy Chicken Sandwich costs $3.09 and today it's free if you wear something that has your favorite sports team.  It's the 2nd time they've offered it free, and the best part it that it's actually a really good sandwich.  

Karen was our server, she was very attentive and smiled a lot.  We got our sandwiches and sat down in the dining area, about 15 min later Karen walked by us and asked if she could refill our drinks.  Wow!  So when did that ever happen at Mickey D's, the BK Lounge, or Taco Hell?  As Flo (Mel's Diner) would say:  ""When Donkey's FLY!!!"".  

So we put in a comment card, gave it to the Team Lead (Veronica?), who was also really sweet and nice.  Karen was jumping for joy since we mentioned her in the card, and I'm just shocked as I've never seen morale that high at any fast food establishment.  Part of me is wondering why the hell did I waste 2 yrs of my HS life working at Wendy's (well, it wasn't all a waste, we did have some great times, I ate a lot of frosties and cookies), while another part of me was thinking I may need to fill out an application and get in on this ""High-On-Chick-Fil-A-Life"" morale booster.  

I love their chicken, especially the tenders.  Their honey mustard and honey bbq sauces are THE BEST condiments I know (yes, better than Mickey D's ketchup).  They have waffle fries, fruit, fresh flowers (sweetheart roses and carnations) on each table, and excellent customer service that usually displayed with all 32 pearly whites.

Jose, the manager, is such a nice guy! We went through the drive-thru on Halloween last year and me, my guy, and our dog were all wearing costumes.

Sadly they couldn't give him pets - but good job following food safety and health regulations - but Jose grabbed a box of nuggets and gave Beau his own 4-piece box!! Needless to say, every time we go back he now tries to climb out the window!! AND Jose has given him his own nuggets AGAIN every time he sees there!  I told him he is my dogs new bff.

I will say that there is a distinct difference between the appearance and attitudes of the employees here vs pretty much every other fast food chain I've been to.  They don't look lifeless and unhappy to be there, and are generally upbeat and noticeably friendlier which makes your decision to eat fast food not feel so depressing.

It was dark, foggy, and raining, and the drive thru line was long. But when you are amongst the masses of chicken sandwich lovers waiting in drive thru, you are practically with family, right?
Anyway, pouring rain, and an employee taps on our window and explains the line was so long because their ordering system lost connection and thus people were ordering at the window. He advised us to order through the mobile app if we could. No big deal, and I started downloading the app on my phone.
A manager comes out a few minutes later and apologizes and asks us if we were taken care of. At this point I was entering payment information into the app, and had our order almost done.  TWO employees, including a manager, were out in the POURING rain making sure their customers were taken care of.
By the time we made it to the window not much longer, our food was handed to us in the same amount of time it would have taken on a perfect day when everything was operational.  Talk about efficiency and customer service! I was WOWED.

1658,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"A review that is long overdue... this is the only chick-fil-a that I have been to in the PNW area, and definitely in the state of OR. It happens to be close to my husband's workplace, so I enjoy stopping by when I have the time and can't resist the craving, which is almost always in the morning. Originally from the south (ATL, Chick-fil-A HQ), my expectations are pretty high of this establishment in particular. Cedar Hills has gotten it right every time I have been here, which has been more than a handful of times. The food is always warm to hot, prepared correctly, and if for some reason they get it wrong, they are always quick to apologize and make it right. They have cute little SOS (save our sauce) signs near the trash receptacles to reduce waste, but still make sure customers are getting ample dipping sauces (a peeve of mine at other places that charge you for an extra bbq sauce... really?? I'm not going to run my card again for another $0.20 for sauce). The ladies restroom is always clean, though one little thing: the soap dispenser is a bit tricky with the dispensing sometimes.. there's always soap in there but the sensor is a bit finicky. Also, the prices for some of the menu items seems to be a bit higher compared to some other locations (e.g.: egg white grill breakfast entree), which I didn't realize varies by location. I enjoy the wordless music that is always playing at the appropriate volume level, so as not to deafen you or make conversation difficult, but still loud enough so that you can hear it clearly. They also offer FREE coffee with your breakfast before 10 AM, I believe... I may be off on the time a bit and I think it's dine-in only because I always dine in when I eat here. Service is always prompt, friendly, and polite. I don't understand what the bad reviews are about.. I've never had less-than-great service.

This tells me that he cares about the establishment, maintaining quality, and keeping both customers and employees happy. (I have never spoken to him nor do I know him. Just letting you know what I've observed. I only realized who he was and what he looked like because he offered a complimentary chicken sandwich via the Chick-fil-A app after I'd visited this location multiple times, and it had a little photo of him next to the offer)

Every now and then I get an email with a free breakfast sandwich deal, which was nice.

Maybe 6 cars in the drive through and they had a lady walking along the cars taking orders. I ordered a spicy  chicken meal with pepper jack cheese and a large coffee. About 6-7 mins later I get to the window and the guy informs me that they almost served me coffee that was made at 10am. Ok cool thanks for not doing that !

Turns out the tea had soured , there was no cheese on my sandwich and the large fries were a medium (receipt says I paid for med at least) but I got charged extra for a coffee I didn't get.

This Chick-fil-A is located inside the CNN Center food court.  As such, it shares seating with the other CNN Center eateries including Moe's, Great Wraps, Chinese/Japanese takeout joints, and other popular American fast food chains.  I stopped by this CFA to pick up dinner before an Atlanta Hawks game at adjacent Philips Arena.  The large open seating area was absolutely packed with fans.  There were so many people eating that some sat on the floor with their backs against the walls.  We shared a table with other folks.

Needless to say, this CFA was super busy.  Fortunately, they were prepared to handle the demand as there was an associate at every cash register.  We didn't have to wait in line more than a minute or two to place our orders and after that, no longer than an additional minute or so to receive our orders.  Kateeka was our server and she processed and delivered our orders politely and with a smile on her face.  It'd be nice if other fast food chains followed suit.

The classic Chicken Sandwich and the Spicy Chicken Sandwich are my favorites.  Only $5.95 and $6.19, respectively, for those sandwiches + medium waffle fries and a drink at this location.  Consistently good.  If you want to try out different dipping sauces for your fries or nuggets, ask for any of the Buffalo Sauce, Buttermilk Ranch, Chick-fil-A Sauce (tangy and smoky), Honey Mustard, or Polynesian Sauce (sweet and sour).

As a west coast person, you hear a lot of rumors about Chick-fil-A. That it has the best chicken sandwiches. That it is the best fast food chain around. That it is better than In-N-Out -- blasphemy, I know. 

Well here's what I think: It's just aiteeee. 

--The waffle fries are as good as advertised, but certainly not better. 

--The chicken sandwich, if you don't eat it immediately, can get a little soggy on you. Now I understand that this is fast food, so I'm not expecting a lot in that respect given all of the grease inherent in making fast food so delicious...it's just that when I pick up take out and eat it only 15 minutes later, I still expect it to be on point. 

So yeah, I can't say I'm the biggest fan. The service at this location was pretty excellent however, with the cashier offering me a four cup carrier for my drinks, extra sauce options, and just generally being fast and extremely pleasant. So bonus points in that department, but that's not really why you come to Chick-fil-A, right? So it goes..

That's a clear need filled right there, and a place where many of us often find ourselves (well at least, I do).

- Chicken strips: usually with a side of their amazing waffle potato fries. This meal usually serves as an appetizer, if I need to satisfy my taste bubs before having a big meal later on.
- Polynesian Sauce: simply divine, I never order a meal without it.
- Milkshake: Not the best milkshakes you'll ever have but it's okay.

From my observation most locations in the Sandy Springs area are victims to this drive thru 'go slow', so expect to play the waiting game but, when you rummage through that white and red paper bag to the treasure within, the taste definitely never disappoints!

1705,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"New Chick-Fil-A at Northlake Festival.  If you know Chick-Fil-A restaurants you know what the food is like.  I have been eating at Chick-Fil-A since they opened their first store in 1967 at Greenbrier Mall in Atlanta (if you don't include the Dwarf Grill where they developed their chicken sandwich).  There's not much reason to review a fast food restaurant, since if you crave a delicious fried chicken sandwich and the other sumptuous things on the menu, this store has the standard menu. 
The Chick-Fil-A at  Northlake Festival has a new design and system for their stand alone operations that I want to praise.  You order from a counter like usual.  However, the cashier area is fairly clear of the hustle and bustle because instead of your order being collected and bagged by the cashier they give you a magnet with a number on it.  You take your number to a table and stick it on a metal stand.  Your order is brought to your table. Our drinks came with our order but you could get refills from the self serve fountain.  Anyway, we liked the operation and think it gives a better dining ambiance to this fast food chain.  The next step should be to try to cut down on paper waste with less packaging and more recycling.

So I walk back up to the counter and told the lady that the minis were cold!
She gave me a box right off the line went! I set down, put on the honey, took a bite, man, cold again! 
I ate them because I'm trying to get some place and be somebody else!
I saw a guy in a blue shirt and tie wiping down tables, and I asked him was he the manager?
He said he was one of them!
I expressed how disappointed I was with the cold minis! 
I also told him that I had walked back up, got another box and it was disapointment as well! He gave me some excuse about the people in the back and then he said 'I'm sorry' and proceeded finish cleaning the tables!
I walked up to the counter to get a refill on my lemonade and again, I expressed my disappointment to the young lady who gave me the second box of minis!

They have well-dressed workers walk around the restaurants table by table to greet customers, pick up any unused trays, or refill drinks. Their smiles and friendly gestures are contagious for sure. 
One cool tip about chick-fil-A that not a lot of people know about: At the end of year, chick-fil-A sells calendars for the upcoming year and when you purchase the calendar (~$7) you receive a chick-fil-A VIP card with it. Using the VIP card, you get a free item from the menu every month plus a surprise on your birthday month! I've been using my VIP card every month - this month I received free Spicy chicken sandwich deluxe and it's definitely a killer deal!!

I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich with just pickles which is juicy and pretty tasty. I'm not a big fan of the waffle fries. I like smaller, crisper fries. I know people talk about the Christian music and I must admit I don't really pay that much attention to it and it's not loud at all.

1712,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"Chick Fil A is a good fast food restaurant. This location is located just off of I-71 in Grove City. The food they serve is healthier than what you get at your standard McDonalds, Burger King, etc... However, I imagine that it isn't like having chicken grilled on your back porch as far as the health is concerned. The sandwiches taste great, although the selection is limited. I ended up having two sandwiches because I was hungry and I got a free one. The charbroiled chicken club was great. It has lettuce, tomato, pickles, and charbroiled chicken, which tasted like it was seasoned by pepper. The basic chicken sandwich, which came free with the club, was just fried chicken and pickles. It was great; there were a few spices mixed in with the breading.

I have been in this place three times, always promptly greeted with a friendly smile and vast knowledge of a menu to which I knew little about prior to my visit. There is currently a push in the inner cities with fast food workers trying to form unions and picketing the business for a higher wage when in most cases I don't feel it is earned. The employees at other places typically look miserable and ready to leave. The staff here was ready to serve. This is the first fast food place where I saw a sense of pride at every position and I would be willing to hire any of these employees on the spot. I love seeing people take pride in what they do whether it is cleaning a bathroom or creating a delicious chicken sandwich because that will translate to future success.

Is it just me, or are you dying for Chick-fil-A every Sunday lol.  The kids that work there seem like a dream, the kind you hope or wish your kids were or that they were hanging out with.

The chicken sandwiches are great. All their ingredients taste fresh and has the right amount of seasoning. The fried chicken items are not really greasy at all which is quite weird.

Two times we've found plastic fried into the sandwiches.  We wrote corporate, and the restaurant owner did send us $20 in gift cards.  Problem is, we really don't want to eat at this location anymore.  We've been driving to the Grove City location for months which is way out of the way.

Yesterday we decided to try this location again as we were nearby and wanted to grab a quick bite.  It was around 6:30pm, the restaurant was filthy.  Tables a mess, floor a mess.  Not what I'm used to with Chick-fil-A, they normally pride themselves with cleanliness.  On to the order - my wife wanted a frosted lemonade, I wanted a lemonade.  They were out, how do you run out of your signature drink?  It's not the first time it's happened here either.  I wanted to try the new mac and cheese.  Out as well.

At that point, there was some kind of problem, and she explained that she was going to have to start the order over.

We were on our way to the hospital to bring a relative and companion in the ER food and help.  Very disappointing!

Good for them. Incidentally, I think He would be vegan. 

But if this is what we're getting in the afterlife, then it's time to pig out in this one. No matter how you dress it up, dry chicken is dry chicken. What's up with that? Do people really prefer it that way? I couldn't tell what made the Spicy Chicken spicy--it might as well have been some injection from a laboratory solution labeled ""heat."" It comes out of nowhere, and pretty much overpowers everything else. The best thing about the carrot-raisin and cole slaw sides was using them as cooling mounds of gelatinous goo for intermittent tongue soothing. 


I'll end this and attempt to delay my inevitable journey to the hot place by pointing out this 620 S location is one very nice fast-food restaurant, bright and clean with faux flowers on every table, a huge and happy indoor kiddy playscape, and a nicely groomed staff all smiley and eager to please. Baked Lays are a good thing, and Coke Zero rocks. If you're avoiding high-fructose corn syrup, you need to be careful of what you order in here, and if you're low-carbing, ask for lettuce wraps and go nuts with the various chicken incarnations. They will accommodate you. They want you to be happy.",0.17881720430107528,Positive

I waited in line to order 2 chicken biscuits and a sausage egg and cheese muffin( I ate breakfast at home) for some friends and my buddy who was getting married today (best man duties). I was on a tight schedule and I was already running late. I get to the register at 10:20 am. Ordered my food and moved aside to wait. Easily 15 people waiting for their food before me so I needed to be patient. 10ish minutes pass and no one has gotten their food. I overhear the manager say to a customer that breakfast is closed and no one is getting breakfast food. No worries, right? I already ordered...wrong! The manager closed breakfast and literally stopped serving breakfast food for even those of us who had already ordered food. I, having a lot of responsibilities today, got frustrated and told the assistant manager that I didn't care if they had stopped serving breakfast, I needed my food and I needed it now. He proceeds to tell me no breakfast food is being served anymore and if I was upset he would give me a refund. He said they were out of chicken biscuits and I told him they could just make more(with the support of the general rabble and everyone else who didnt get what they ordered) and he ""just cant do that"". Myself, along with the 15 people before me did not receive any breakfast food and we all waited in line for a refund and/or exchange for food. Me, leading the charge of irration, was the first to get a refund. I asked for 3 chicken sandwiches in exchange for the food I ordered and didnt get so I could bring something back to my hungover friends. Took TEN minutes for the assistant manager to work out the refund and new charge for my new order. I wait another TWENTY minutes with no movement. I boiled over and told the manager I dont have time for this s*** and I have suits to pick up and errands to run so just throw 3 chicken sandwiches at me and I'll pick them up off the floor and get out. They immediately give me my order and I said twice before I left, 3 chicken sandwiches, right? Assistant manager said yes twice. Got my food, left(11:10am) and went to my buddies house. 3 bacon egg and cheese biscuits. Breakfast food and not what I ordered, incredible. What the F***. Pathetic service, poor management, and even more pathetic conflict resolution abilities. Stopped serving breakfast food? Hmmm why the f*** did I come home with 3 breakfast items I didnt order? Sad.

Let me start by saying, this place was packed. Every table was filled with all walks of life from parents with their children to construction workers to business people in suits. I cannot remember the last time I ate at a fast food restaurant and saw people sitting down. 

The service was very great. Our cashier Dionne was so pleasant to work with. She suggested the best sauces to try our food with and gave us one of each to try. We sat down and the food was brought to us instead of us having to pick it up. Throughout our meal we had someone check up on us and ask if we needed refills on our drinks or napkins etc. It was a very thoughtful. 

I ordered a number one which was an original chicken sandwich with fries. My chicken sandwich was great. There was a nice piece of chicken inside and the bun was very good. My waffle fries were hot and plentiful.

Was handed a large cup with my receipt with no explanation. Different from other fast food they brig your food to the table ( not the beverage) My grilled chicken arrived with my salad. First thing I noticed was that my salad dressing was missing that I ordered. When he came back I had bitten into my sandwich and realized there was no mayo or sauce on the sandwich.

They don't claim to have the BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH, but rather as the home of ORIGINAL CHICKEN SANDWICH, which I am totally fine with.

If you have never tried Chick-fill-A, then I recommend you do so purely just so that you can tell people you tried it. Once you eat it though, I don't think you will be blown away or anything like that. It really doesn't taste that amazing haha.

The Chick-Fil-A in the Burlington Mall is the closest one you'll find in the Boston area.  It's located in the food court and offers at least a healthier form of fast food than many of the other offerings.  I have eaten at other Chick-Fil-A's across the country and this one is totally comparable.

My go to meal is the original chicken sandwich with waffle fries and sweet tea.  The chicken sandwich is breaded lightly and fried lightly in peanut oil (a healthier oil alternative).  Served with pickles on a soft bun, the sandwich really requires no sauce or toppings.  The pickles and the nutty flavor of the fried chicken is all you need.  The waffle fries are big crunchy and delicious.  The sweet tea is exactly the way it should be... super sweet.

I love Chick-Fil-A, as someone who used to spend time in the south, it's the best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had north of the Mason-Dixon. Came with a friend today for lunch and after deciding what we wanted, we ordered from the very perky cashier. Our food was up before we even had a chance to try to scout a table. We sat down, not too far from the counter and were shortly afte greeted by a nice young woman named Rachel wearing a Chick-Fil-A jersey. She asked how everything was and if we needed anything. We had just started eating and were set with condiments and napkins so we said thanks, but we were all set. She then told us to let her know if we need any refills. Wait... what!!?? Chick-Fil-A has free refills. She walked away and my friend and I say aghast for a few minutes remarking on how we never knew they did that before. We continued eating and watched Rachel make her way to a few other tables in the area and have the same conversation. All with a smile and a really genuine attitude. She came back as we were close to wrapping up our meal and offered again for refills, we took her up on it and when she came back, I asked if this was new, she said no, they always have free refills. In addition, they also sell their sweet tea in gallons for you to take home (cue me doing a little happy dance). Turns out she was the wife of the new franchise manager and used to work at the corporate office in GA. She told us to spread the word about Chick-Fil-A and come back. Honestly, i know it seems a little silly, but it was such a positive experience in what is normally a run-of-the-mill fast food experience.

1805,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"While the chicken in my sandwich was both moist and more than decent, this still remains a fast food chain and thus has it's limits in terms of both quality and nutrition. 

After a short drive over for some lunch with my girlfriend, we parked, crossed halfway across this mall and made our way to the food court and then to this Chick-Fil-A location. She had eaten at one of them before, in the south, but I had never had been to one. Although I don't eat much fastfood, if ever (In-N-Out aside!), I was rather excited at the prospect that this could be a decent meal. 

I decided to get a deluxe Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich with a banana pudding milkshake. The sandwich featured a giant slab of chicken breast which is layered alongside some dill pickle chips, tomato, lettuce and American cheese. It was served in a regular bun although they also offer it in a wheat bun (I had no idea). As I stated earlier, the chicken itself was ridiculously good - it was moist, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The sandwich wasn't dry and the ingredients worked very well together and I must say that it exceeded my expectations.

Then came the milkshake which was very sweet, a bit too sweet for my taste. But the flavor was rather unique for us 'Yankees' in the North. Banana pudding isn't something we find often around here and having it in a milkshake was interesting to say the least. It had bits of nilla wafers floating around it in, creating these little chunks of deliciousness. Those same chunks also kept clogging my straw though which wasn't as much fun...

All in all, this joint provides some more than decent, tender chicken goodness alongside some casual, Southern-inspired fare. From sweet ice tea to carrot and raisin salad, waffle potato fries and spicy chicken wraps, the options are varied. Most of it isn't all that healthy but they do seem to make a better effort than most fast food chains.

The cashier was very friendly as was the rest of the staff, going as far as walking up to nearby patrons in the food court and offering free refills on some of their drinks. I'd love to be able to give them 3 and a half stars but this not being possible, I will round it down because... well... despite the chicken being good, they are a chain... and somewhat unhealthy.

On a side-note, I'm not sure if it's related, but I also did have a stomach-ache thirty minutes after my meal, on the drive home. It could have been from something else, I'm not sure.",0.08432971014492754,Positive
1806,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"Whoa Nellie, all these glowing reviews for a mall food court stand. During my annual holiday schlep to the malls, I was pleasantly surprised at how the otherwise deadly dull Burlington Mall had a pretty decent food court, at least going by my very nice experience at ShotCakes (try a Red Velvet or Cookie Dough) and Charley's Grilled Subs (that was a darn good cheesesteak). I saw the Chick-Fil-A across the way, and thought, ""Hmmm...maybe next holiday season, if they are still here...""

But I had reason to go by there again recently, and  thought to check out the Yelp reviews for the Chick-Fil-A beforehand to see if that was worth skipping over another cheesesteak. The reviews were certainly promising enough so I stopped by in the evening and got the ""Classic"" chicken sandwich, waffle fries and a Coke. 

Unfortunately and surprisingly, my experience was very, very different from the glowing Yelp reviews: the chicken tasted like supermarket fried chicken that was left in the warmer for too long, and it was on this really cheap, cheap hamburger bun. As far as the waffle fries go, I only have the waffle fries at Charlie's Kitchen to compare them to, and Charlie's blows them away in terms of crispness and taste. Granted that Charlie's is not a fast food stand, still... At least the Coke was fresh and bubbly, and the overall meal was cheap enough.

I didn't want to post such a negative review based on just one sandwich experience. so I actually made another trip a day or so later to verify my experience, and for comparison I also stopped by McDonald's twice: once for their ""Classic"" chicken sandwich (crispy style), and once for their ""Southern Style Chicken Sandwich,"" which is reportedly a close knock-off of the Chick-Fil-A Classic. 

In the order I had them: the McDonald's Classic came on a much nicer roll and the chicken was predictably good enough to polish off easily but not nearly good enough to generate a craving for one later. I then had another Chick-Fil-A Classic and instead of the waffle fries, I got a large chocolate shake on a whim when I saw someone else get one. The chicken this time was much better than from my first trip, but,,,,it was still just OK. It was a little bit more tasty than the McDonald's Classic, but it still had the cheap, too soft hamburger bun. Overall, I would give the McDonald's a very slight edge. The chocolate shake, though, rocked, which was helped by the old-school inclusion of whipped cream and a cherry on top. If you include the shake, that actually did make for nice meal. A couple of days later I popped in a McDonald's again, this time for their ""Southern Style Chicken Sandwich"" and that turned out to be nearly identical to the Chick-Fil-A, both in flavor and having (unfortunately) a cheap soft bun. I got it with an ice coffee, and that actually worked very well with the sandwich. Sandwich to sandwich, it was pretty much a toss-up. The Chick-Fil-A is slightly cheaper, though.

To be fair, I was comparing the sandwiches from a full blown McDonald's to a food court stand, but apparently the only Chick-Fil-A's in this area are at mall food courts, and there was a line the second time I went, so they apparently do have fans, Still, in all honesty I have to give that  first sandwich only 1 star and the second a 3, so I''m splitting the difference.

1818,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"Love, love, love Chick-Fil-A. Growing up in the South, you find one of these every mile, and it was always the place to go when McDonald's or Burger King didn't cut it, which was often.

When I came up to Boston for school and found out that there was a Chick-Fil-A in the general vicinity, I was so happy. Then I mapquest'd it and realized it was not even close to where I was staying, which put me into a deep depression. You will understand once you've had a taste. There aren't many things I have a craving for, but Chick-Fil-A is definitely up there on the list. 

Well, I ended up getting here eventually through public transportation and it was just absolute heaven. Thank God it's just as good here as in the South, and dare I say maybe even better. I had the Chicken Sandwich and it was just juicy and fried and delicious. I know there are other things on the menu, but this is what you eat when you haven't been to Chick-Fil-A in a while. Couple that with waffle fries and wash it down with sweet tea and you've made this southern boy very, very happy. 

Other reasons to love Chick-Fil-A:

1) Food - Much better than other fast food places. While it's not particularly healthy, the food is of much higher quality, so you don't feel as guilty. I like everything on the menu, even the salads (which I normally dislike). The new additions of milkshakes and parfaits are great.

2) Service - I didn't know what to expect since I've had my fair share of bad customer service up in the North, and this is just a fast food place, but I was surprised to see that they had instilled some good ole' southern hospitality in the workers. The workers were very friendly and polite. Some guy even offered to refill my cup while I was eating... awesome! 

3) Community involvement - I don't know about their community relations here, but I know they've always given back to the local community and schools. In Georgia, basically each town has its local Chick-Fil-A, and they always partner with schools to award student achievement  (free coupons!). I know they have their own scholarship program as well.

The only negative I had was that prices were more expensive than down south -- paid almost $7 for the meal instead of $5 to 6. But I am willing to put up with that as long as I can get my hands on that damn good sandwich.

Writing this is making my mouth water. I'll definitely be back again as soon as I get a craving. For those who haven't had the chance to experience the magic, I encourage you to drop everything you're doing and go ASAP (unless it's Sunday). Eat more chikin!",0.26096194503171244,Positive

At other fast food places I've had to wait like ten minutes for my food when it's busy but with Chick Fil A I am in and out fast. The food is great always hot and taste fresh.  Very reasonably priced. And healthier than most other fast food option. It depresses me that this is the only Chick Fil in the whole state because I really like the food. I was there today and there was a huge line, I expected to have to wait forever to place and order and get my food but someone took my order within 2 minutes and 2 minutes later I had my sandwich. And they don't charge extra for sauce like Mcdonalds does and always ask if you want any with whatever you order. I was sitting in the middle of the food court today and a Chick Fil A employee came up to me and asked if I'd enjoyed my food and if I'd like a refill on my drink. This was the first time I'd experienced such great customer service at a fast food place. They also have much healthier meals for kids like their new grilled chicken nuggets which with ketchup or honey mustard even the very picky two year old I babysit will eat. YAY Chick Fil A. Always an easy choice at the food court this Burlington Mall is the only place I don't have to spend 20 minutes deciding where I want to eat.  Other good things are their Diet Lemonade, 15 calories and it tastes GREAT (it has Splenda in it) and the Banana Pudding milkshake they have as a special in the spring.

I usually order their Classic chicken sandwich, but I make it Deluxe (ooh, add lettuce and tomato, fancy).  That is one delicious piece of fried chicken.  The meat is juicy, you get A LOT of chicken, and the breading is delectably spiced for just the right flavor.  And they don't over-do it with the breading.  And can you say waffle fries???  I love their waffle fries.  I remember when I was a kid, I would look forward to eating at Chick-Fil-A for their waffle fries.  They're so much fun!  How do they make them???  I know now, but they're still just as awesome.

And they have 6 dipping sauces to choose from!  My favorite is the Polynesian (like sweet and sour) and then the honey mustard.  Pour some on your sandwich, dip your fries in them, no need for ketchup!  And I love ketchup.

The service was outstanding too!  My server(?) was super friendly and tried to chat me up.  I know some people might not like that, but I think it's a nice touch that differentiates them from everyone else.  At most food court places, when you ask for tap water, they give it to you in the smallest cup they can find.  Not here.  I received my water in a large cup!

I noticed that all the food vendors were offering samples, so I ambled once 'round the court, taking in some very mediocre General Gau's glop at the Asian joint, a bit of a soggy crepe with tunafish at the crepe joint, and a piece of a cold cheesesteak at the toasted sub place.

After briefly thinking ""Hey! Once or twice more more around the circle and dinner will be ""welfare dim sum,"" I remembered that unlike the blech I'd just eaten, that first piece of chicken was actually GOOD.

I'd swear the nuggets were right out of the fryer, couldn't eat them for 5 min. Which gave me time to start on the waffle fries. Perfectly cooked so they weren't pasty inside. Got a delicious Spicy Deluxe (adds lettuce, tomato, & choice of cheese (I chose Pepper jack) Chicken sandwich on an optional wheat bun. The chicken is always so juicy.

I also got the limited time only Banana Pudding Shake. Whoa! What's that chunky stuff in there? 'Nilla wafer cookies! Yum.

2hr drive from home? Yep. Will I be back? Hey Koolaid, OH YEAH!",0.11761904761904764,Positive

Both taste different and are delicious! And they have heavenly WAFFLE FRIES! It's delicious and the best chicken sandwich in my opinion.

I actually really love their lemonade. It's all delicious and pulpy just like fresh squeezed lemonade should be.

And the chicken itself isn't puny like other fast foods...its chunky and SO GOOD. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their waffle fries too. I love fries in general but these fries are addicting. I LOVE how they have different sauces too...I personally love the chick-fil-a sauce. I don't know what they put in there but there's probably crack in it. 

Best part: I don't like tomatoes and I always ask for no tomatoes. They fulfill my request....AND they take off $0.15. Now that's honest business! I go here...probably almost every week.

And Boston Business Real-Estate Entrepreneur people, you need to learn something from this too, like uhh, build one in BOSTON. You can't get any better than this. You can't. It puts all other nuggets and chicken sandwiches to shame. And what's more exciting than eating the Nuggets From Heaven and Waffle Fries of Absolute Joy as the Chick Fil A cow comes along and waves. Nothing. I'm from the South and miss having a CFA so close. Going to Burlington is worth the Pilgrimage (for those who don't know how to get there from Boston, it's EASY. Take the 350 from Alewife. It takes you right to the mall). If you've never gone, you need to try it. It will change your life. If it doesn't, it's not my fault your taste buds are deficient. Actually, if you don't like it, I'd blame it on all the Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts coffee you've been consuming (it probably burned your tastebuds off). I think you'll like it though. Every time I go, the CFA is the MOST crowded of all the food court restaurants. I wish CFA would be open on Sundays, but whatever. At least they have a guaranteed day off per week!

I loved the waffle fries because they were a decent size and they gave me my money's worth. That original sauce is everything!

(1) They had signs up saying buns couldn't be buttered or toasted that night due to equipment problems.
(2) I ordered a Key Lime Shake and they asked me what size, large or small? I said large and they said they were out of large... such jokers.
(3) The girl making the shakes said they were out of lemonade and would have to give me diet lemonade. But she said that would taste the same. That's hard to believe.
(4) The machine would not take my Visa card and we tried the chip and swiping repeatedly with no luck. Meanwhile, other customers came and went on other machines.
(5) As I was finally finished (I thought), the girl gave me the shake, then suddenly took it back--she had apparently made the wrong type of shake. I watched her trying to repair it (no new shake) somehow.
The chicken sandwich was pretty good but the shake was mediocre--was it the lemonade, the lousy prep, or perhaps they're always awful? I'm not sure but have no plans to find out.",-0.09216450216450216,Negative
1839,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"This was my first time peeping out The Chick. I came here just after 10 antimeridian and no one was in line. I perused the menu and ordered the Deluxe Spicy Chicken Sandwich. ""Deluxe"" meant a slice of Pepper Jack cheese and pickles and tomato and lechuga.  I ordered it solo and it was $5.47 including Uncle Sam's share. It came in a few minutes and I wolfed it down in under two minutes. It was steaming hot and was tasty but felt it was real teenie for the money. It was no more than an appetizer that fueled my appetite for a food-court crawl. The chicken patty was juicy and tender and definitely better than what you'd usually get at a ""regular"" restaurant. I would give it five stars if it were more bigger. I do feel that The Chick needs much bigger breasts in order to satisfy moderately hungry YELPers. However, I would peep it out again but I would need to order two breasts in my sammie in order to be fulfilled. Also, I do feel that they should be more creative as their choices are wicked basic.

When he finally turned around and realized I was standing there he still didn't act professionally and continued joking around instead of taking the order. Additionally he didn't know a couple answers to basic questions like what's in the salad and can we leave something off of it. Wife is pregnant and couldn't have soft cheeses.

Then I split an order of fries with someone or bum some fries off my girlfriend.  The fries are great when they are hot and fresh but kinda really plain tasting when not.  Note that they don't have a ton of salt on them so they are no doubt healthier than most fast food fries but of course don't taste as good if you are a salt-o-holic LOL.  

They also have fantastic chicken noodle soup, about the only better you will find is the Bob Evans chicken noodle soup but you're going to pay more for it.  

I also really love Chick-Fil-A for their political beliefs and their willingness to speak up for them.  Yes I was one of the people who waited 3 hours for chicken when they had Chick-Fil-A appreciation day around Halloween.  I support Chick-Fil-A's right to express their religious beliefs 100% and anyone else who supports freedom of speech should as well.

Second, for some reason, they no longer serve hot and crispy fries. They have consistently been lukewarm and limp. Yuck. And I don't have time or energy when in a hurry to exchange them, nor should you need to.

All this for about $12 was pretty reasonable for a lunch before heading to the Orlando airport! We didn't wait too long to get our sandwiches and they were pretty good. The sandwich had a pretty good spice to it without it being too spicy. I would have liked the pepper jack cheese to be melted just a little bit more though. Overall it was a pretty good chicken sandwich! Oh I love how they put pickles in there too! Portion wise the sandwich was pretty filling. Waffle fries were just ok as they were a little bit soggy. I liked the chicken sandwich and fries here but couldn't help but compare it to McDonald's. I guess chick fil a has healthier and/or fresher ingredients but the flavors are almost the same to me.

We went through the drive-thru and ordered breakfast and also two regular chicken sandwiches that we took into the Park each day for lunch.  I had no idea they served the chicken sandwiches during breakfast.  I was surprised they said, ""Yes"" when I asked.  They don't have them ready though, so you will have to wait about 10 minutes for them.  

I have been going to Chick-Fil-A restaurants for many, many years and I've been to a lot of them.  I gave this one 5 stars because of the fabulous customer service we received every morning.  Most of you already know that Chick-Fil-A is known for their outstanding customer service at all of their restaurants, but they really went above and  beyond here.  

A little something extra they did here every morning was put mints and those little hand sanitizer napkins in the bag with our food.  It may not seem like much, but I haven't seen it done at any Chick-Fil-A before.  

Because we had to wait the 10 minutes every morning, we would have to pull forward.  Each morning a different person brought our food out, but every one of them brought it with a smile and wished us a good day.

The size of the piece of chicken on the sandwiches were also huge every day on every single sandwich.

Once I made up my mind I had the spicy chicken sandwich meal with a side of buffalo sauce.  When I completed my order I thanked her and she responded with ""have a blessed day"", well that put a smile on my face. 
So as I was sitting eating my lunch I found myself humming to the music coming through their speakers (all instrumental) made me wonder where I had heard it from and why it was familiar. It took me a moment and then it came to me, ""I sing that in church!"".  What a nice addition to her blessing my day.  Then as I walked up to refill my soda before I left I saw written on their chalk board Psalm 91.

The restaurant had about 3 employees out there taking orders and greeting customers.

The restaurant has warmers installed above where the staff stands to take orders by the way (talk about taking care of your employees). 

I walked in and was greeted as usual. The line was fairly short and I got my food within 10 minutes. While I sat at a table to wait, someone brought me my order and asked if I needed anything else. In addition, about 10 minutes into me enjoying the meal, someone came around and asked if I needed a refill...I almost felt like I needed to leave a tip on the table when I was leaving. 

I got the regular chicken sandwich (free from the owner for downloading the app and setting that restaurant as my ""default,"" if you will) with a large fry and a large coke.

Well the other night (Thursday October 24th) I was craving a spicey chicken sandwich. I stopped by on my way home from the airport to the location right at Perimeter mall. Not the one in the mall. 

I sat in the drive thru line which was huge, but it didn't move. Odd, because usually CFA processes drive thru lines well. After seeing no movement I decided to run inside to get my sandwich. Well it looked like a bomb had gone off with trash everywhere. The line was 8-10 deep, I saw nobody working the register, and there were about 6 groups of people standing waiting for their food looking quite annoyed. I asked one of the people waiting if he had been waiting long and he said ""oh yeah.""  

That's all I needed. Off to somewhere else I went.

I'm supposed to be boycotting this restaurant because of its open, egregious hostility towards the GLBT community. Personally, this would be easy, as fried chicken sandwiches aren't well sported in the form of love handles and belly fat. But the siren song of chicken sandwiches and waffle fries was hard to ignore, especially when your stomach was embroiled in an epic battle with vodka, Lone Star, and four or five shots of something pink. 

Fine--I'm a scab.

There wasn't much of a line, and the employee was an attractive young lady whose perkiness and obvious lack of a hangover was simultaneously refreshing and endlessly annoying. 

Chick-Fil-A did its duty Saturday morning by providing warm, delicious fast food to two fabulous people obviously recovering from tying one on. In a big, gay bar. Did you hear that, Chick-Fil-A? 

Fine. You got ONE order out of us. But this boycott is sooo back on. You and Target can go sit in the corner and think about what you've done, until you decide to join the 21st century.

Although Chick-Fil-A is everywhere here in Austin, back where I used to live in Boston, there was only 1 outlet, and it was located in the food court of Burlington Mall. My friend Wendy was actually the one who introduced me to this chain. She's crazy about their chicken sandwich, and I must say, after my first try, I became a fan, too. Their sweet tea is really sweet, which I like (I'm addicted to sugar, I know...). Every time we went, I usually ordered the bite-sized chicken nuggets with the waffle fries and the sweet tea. Here in Austin, since there's so many of them around, it doesn't feel quite like a special treat anymore. But their sweet tea is still good and addictive.

Too often we go to a fast food restaurant and receive horrendous service but Chick-fil-A is definitely the exception. The employees here are always polite and they know how to take care of their customers. You'll notice it's their pleasure to take your order, to provide you your requested Polynesian sauce, to refill your drink, bring your order to your table, etc. This service sets them apart from the rest and their long lines are a testament to their excellent service.

I could give this Chick-fil-A three or four stars and complain about the long line at both the drive thru and the register in the dining room. But that would be unfair. Especially when the employees do their best to get the line moving. The only problem I had here was trying to back out of my parking space. But that is a minor detail.
With a long line for drive thru service, I decided to go inside and order at the counter. Although the line was long, it moved at a rapid pace. My server, Debbie, was very friendly and courteous. And my order came out quickly. Before you could even say ""Eat mor chikin'!""
I ordered the medium Chick-fil-A sandwich, and a medium drink and french fries. LOVE the french fries! My total cost came up to $6.38. And both the sandwich and fries were served hot.
Other fast food restaurants serve a decent chicken sandwich. But Chick-fil-A, hands down, serves up the best chicken sandwich. 
This location, in the Colonial Plaza Marketplace, is a convenient location. Whether you are shopping, or coming in on a lunch break, this Chick-fil-A is ideal. The line may be long and it may be busy, but you will come out with a hot meal in a timely manner. So don't be intimidated if you see a lot of cars in the drive thru or parking lot. That is a sign that someone is doing something right and that the food is great.

I think the cashier that took my ordered was lost or just not in the same planet I was in. 

The food was good, made fresh but for one chicken sandwich it cost me over $3.00 bucks, I think ChickFilA is over priced. The other person I was with had a chicken sandwich and a coke just the both together it was $5.00. 

This location needs better staff and people that can run the registers. It also seems like some skateboard kids stop by in here every Friday because  I notice one of the lady's that works there saying something to the manager and then him just telling her to clean it up after the kids left a mess in there table.

I go to the drive-thru and it being 9:20PM on a Saturday night, they ran out of spicy chicken sandwiches. They informed me that it's a 5 minute wait and offered something in the meantime. The young man was apologetic and extremely friendly and did his best to serve me at that short moment despite the 6+ cars behind me. I didn't want anything extra but I parked my car in a reserved spot, and waited.

About five minutes later and a nice young woman comes up to my car and apologizes profusely and comes to me with fresh food and a coupon for a free meal for the next time.

You don't get it any better than that. I had no problem waiting, especially since they were apologetic and attempted to resolve the situation in a quick, efficient matter, and that's something extremely rare in the fast-food world. When something is wrong in a different fast food restaurant, they don't care that you wait and usually don't apologize, but this particular Chick-fil-A does (and likely other branches) and they do it with a genuine smile.

I always order either nuggets or strips. Don't get me wrong, the sandwiches are delightful...I just can't fulfill my sauce addiction properly with a sandwich. I need to be able to dip every perfect bite into either Polynesian, honey mustard, or barbecue. (I get two of each one every time. I apologize to whoever happens to be working the window, but their lack of surprise in my request makes me think I am not the only one who comes just short of drinking Polynesian with my dinner.)

I actually/generally speaking like Zaxby's better than Chick-fil-A. In my humble opinion their food is seasoned a little better although it can be a touch on the salty side. That being said, I hadnt eaten all day, needed to make it to the bank and I know Chick-fil-A to be quick. Not to mention I had a weird craving for waffle fries. 

This location was just that. Granted it was 3pm, long after the lunch rush. But I found the cashier to be friendly, engaged and quite helpful. If it werent for her I would have forgotten they offered Ranch dressing. And their Ranch is quite tasty indeed. I ended up getting a Deluxe Chicken Sandwich (fried) w Pepper Jack, Lettuce, Tomatoes and Pickles. The sandwich was pretty good. Nothing spectacular like my sandwich the other day from El Super Pan but then again its Chick-fil-A. Fries could have been a touch warmer/hotter. I also got an Arnold Palmer but forgot on freagin tart their Lemonade is. Luckily they had no issue pouring some out and putting more Sweet Tea. Still not a Waffle House Arnold Palmer but beggars cant be choosers. 

All in all cost me $7, saved me time and was satifying enough given the convenience. This location in my experience is pretty solid. And its nice that if you're dining in they bring the food to you. Nice touch.",0.1810185185185185,Positive

They are always professional and welcoming.  Something is missing in Decatur.   They've been around for about 12 years, and they have gone down hill over the past 5 years.  

 This location has always had quality control issues.    I dislike just about everything, except it's super close to my house.   I seem to always have an issue with my order.  90% of the time something is left out.  They never put the BBQ sauce with my grilled chicken sandwich, Fixings with the Salad,  etc,  and they NEVER EVER EVER ASK if I ""need anything else""     Someone on here posted a photo of container half full of Waffle fries.  I can assure you that is not an isolated incident. I experience the same thing frequently.   My order today was dry, stale and luke warm (tortilla soup)  and not very filling.  The chicken patties here seem to be a lot smaller here compared to other stores.  Waffle fries were overly crispy and luke warm (not good)    The employees at this location are almost always indifferent, and not very professional.

I have to say they were right.  Their classic sandwich was unlike any fried chicken sandwich I ever had.  It looked and tasted like a real chicken breast and was really moist and juicy.  It was pretty damn good for fast food.

First strike - the restaurant and bathroom was not clean. I probably could've over looked it ... but it's CHIK-FIL-A. I was excited to pee in a clean public restroom - nope. 
Second Strike - the nonchalantness of the staff. There was no acknowledgement, no excuse me while passing by, just gossipy chatter among the crew. Once again .... it's CHIK FIL A - nope. 
Third - the food. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich meal. ( my go to when I'm not ordered the spicy chicken)  The grilled chicken was so little - it was like a grilled chicken strip. Then the bun was not whole grain - yes I noticed. It was like a honey oat bun. Not what I wanted.

After ordering we in the drive thru we pull up to pay and right there on the window is their food and health score. The way they had the paper folded you couldn't tell what they were deducted points for. The received a score of a 71 which in my opinion should be closed until the store can rectify changes. We were in shock but we were also starving and waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes in the heat. We got home and the peach milk shakes tasted funny and just the thought of us eating the food from a place that got a score 71 was destroying our appetite to even eat.

Their chicken is delish! Very fresh and juicy, and their sauces are the BEST! Honey Roasted BBQ and Polynesian are my favorite. The chicken sandwiches they are famous for.... well there's a reason WHY they are famous for it! SO GOOD (next to them being the first)

I went through the drive thru today for lunch with a co-worker at this location. We both ordered two spicy chicken sandwich meals with chickfila sauce and even paid together just to make it easier. It is typically busy during lunch hour so we expect to have to wait a few minutes, however this parking lot and the wait time just to turn right into the parking lot from Hwy 71 is absurd. What made it worse is after waiting in this mayhem, we got back to our office on South Lamar to discover we were given the wrong order entirely. We opened our bag to find an 8-count chicken nugget meal with fries, which is not even close to what we ordered. Our receipt was also right on top of our incorrect meal with the correct order printed on the receipt ticket???

We then get back in the car and drive all the way back to the location to correct the order. We understand accidents happen but when my co-worker asked to speak with a manager, he was told there was no manager on duty.....NO MANAGER on duty during one of the BUSIEST hours of the day?!?!? That is just not acceptable. The guy at the counter went back and grabbed two spicy chicken sandwiches and tossed them in a bag and handed them to my co-worker assuming that alone would appease him. He explained to the guy at the counter that we just lost an hour of our day driving back and forth to this location and were not happy about the entire experience from start to finish and wanted to speak to someone about it that could correct the situation...manager or no manager. The guy at the counter said ""this is the best I can do"", handed my co-worker the bag, and didn't seem to care about the inconvenience or the fact that we were upset. Again, I understand accidents happen but I've never seen such horrible customer service and down right carelessness. We left with no chickfila sauce, no receipt, and couldn't be more dissatisfied.

In a nutshell, if you're looking for a good chickfila meal that is correct every time, then spare yourself the wasted time, energy, and frustration by avoiding this Ben White location and going to the Southpark Meadows or the 360/Westlake locations instead. Not to mention, those locations are always on point with their customer service, unlike this nightmare of a location.",-0.0072249589490968906,Neutral

I got a classic chicken sandwich on a toasted, buttered bun. The only thing other than breaded chicken on it were pickle slices. Simple, and very good.

I could have gotten ranch dressing or mayo, sure (and the condiment selection is ingeniously displayed outside the drive-thru window). But my simple little sandwich was perfect.

This place has an impressive drink selection. I got half sweet tea/half unsweetened tea; Alicia got half diet lemonade (yes, they also have non-diet)/half fruit punch.

And for the doggie we were given a BIG dog biscuit at the drive-thru window. Wow.

The employees have to say something like ""It's been my pleasure"" instead of ""you're welcome,"" which I find vaguely amusing and creepy at the same time (you know, that feeling that big corporations inspire), but I that's just one of those quirks I always notice.

All of them are spot on, if I was to ever open a fast food restaurant I would follow the Chick-fil-A model (minus the religious views and anti-gay sentiments but those things don't change the quality of my food). 

I love the simple chicken sandwich and waffle fries. It is always hot and fresh. I generally add a side of nuggets which come out the same way. 

The sweet tea and lemonade are also good purchases, but as far as beverages go with the milkshake, i know they don't seem like the place but their milkshakes are amazing.

They must employ a very good management team because my order is always fresh, always, correct, and always good.  There is something about waffle fries that give a restaurant a favorable nod in my mind.  Get a number one with sweet tea  and a side pack of nuggets and you will be happy.  Don't overlook the condiments.  They have honey roasted barbecue sauce that comes in a packet and it literally blows my mind.  Don't miss out on the liquid smack.

Even had a laugh at my misunderstanding of the Polynesian sauce because I called it the tropical Caribbean style sauce.  Later on as I sat at my table polishing off my delicious spicy chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets, I slurped my drink and as an employee was passing by keeping the floors meticulously clean she heard my slurp and asked if I would like a refill.

My chicken sandwich never looked so sexy. and it taste so darn good. It had a buttery fresh goodness taste, crisp green lettuce and nice thick waffle cut fries to compliment every bite.

Upon entering this location I notice how clean the establishment was. The workers looked genuinely happy to take my order.

1964,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"I've been to this Chick-fil-A (CFA) so many times, and it's honestly my favorite!  Why?  Sure, this location is very close to my workplace, so it's super convenient for me to swing by for breakfast or lunch when I don't bring food from home.  But the true reason I love this CFA is the manager, Heather!  She is so amazing.  Heather remembers most of her regular customers by name, including mine - even though my trips to CFA are usually only once every few weeks or so!  I have never seen her with anything other than a smile on her face, even on those super busy days when CFA is giving away a free breakfast item!  That's what I call outstanding customer service.  As for the rest of the staff, I have seen a lot of turnover here, and they are not always the nicest CFA employees I have come across.  However, Heather honestly makes up for this.

While it wouldn't hurt for the staff to be friendlier, this is a high-traffic CFA due to its location surrounded by office buildings in Midtown.  Lines are often long, but they move pretty quickly.  This is one of the most efficient CFA restaurants I have been to!  However, I do recommend that anyone who likes CFA download the mobile app through which you can place and pay for an order, basically ""skipping"" the physical line and getting your food quicker.

I don't think I really need to say much about the food since it's consistently good CFA grub.  Again, I love the Chick-fil-A One app, which makes the ordering process super easy for picky folks like myself who don't want pickles in their sandwich and do want several different dipping sauces.  I'm a fan of the Garlic & Herb Ranch, BBQ, and their (fairly) new Sweet & Spicy Sriracha sauces, and I love that sauces are always free.  Chicken sandwiches and waffle fries are always served piping hot and fresh - likely because they're constantly busy during lunch hours.  Additionally, when there is a promotion for a free food item (typically breakfast, with no purchase necessary), they are on top of it and have plenty of it ready to hand out.

Other than their classic chicken sandwich, waffle fries, chicken biscuit, and Chick-n-Minis, I've really enjoyed their Superfood Side (salad) and their (recently new) Hash Brown Scramble (breakfast) bowl!  

For those who don't regularly come to this particular CFA, I will let you know that menu prices are a bit higher than standalone CFAs.  However, for those who don't work walking distance but still want to grab CFA from this location, there are a few designated - and free - parking spots right outside of the 725 office building for CFA customers!  Sweet!

Overall, this CFA in Midtown gets all 5 stars from me!  Thank you, Heather, for being so awesome - and for cranking out tasty CFA food every weekday!  I'll continue to frequent this CFA for its convenience, amazing manager, and delicious food!

* Tips *
1. Download the CFA One app!  It's so convenient to have and worth it as every purchase brings you closer to earning free treats - including dessert items and sandwiches!  Sometimes, the store will add free treats to your account for no reason at all.
2. Buy the CFA calendar when it's available around the end of each year!  For 2018, it's only $8 (plus tax), and you receive a ""calendar card"" with it which allows you to redeem a free item (and sometimes, two!) each month from CFA, ranging from a Dasani bottled water or soft drink to a regular, spicy, or grilled Chicken Sandwich - with no purchase necessary!  The calendar basically pays for itself after 2 or 3 visits.  Love it!",0.23627465127465128,Positive

I suggest making it a deluxe version so that it includes lettuce and tomato, which would make the sandwich more balanced, so just a few cents more. It comes with your choice of one of their sauces, and I usually go with their Chick fil a sauce which tastes sort of a mix of honey mustard and bbq sauce?

Their breakfast biscuits are also pretty good, but you have to get there early enough to get them. I wished they served them all day long.

Not sure if it was because it was sitting for a while. Every time I have ordered the regular chicken sandwich, it is always crispy fresh and a very thick and tender cut of chicken. The regular has a subtly sweet flavor (or maybe it tasted that way only because I ate it after the spicy one).

1967,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"I stopped by this Chick-fil-A ""Express"" for lunch on a recent recruiting visit to Georgia Tech.  Chick-fil-A existed on campus when I attended school here.  Back then, it was located on the second floor of the Student Center, inside the food court.  Today, Chick-fil-A is on the first floor in the Student Center Commons with other restaurants like Taco Bell, Subway, and Einstein Bros. Bagels.

This Chick-fil-A is branded ""Express"" because it does not have a full menu.  It looked like this location only offered half the menu offerings a regular Chick-fil-A would, if not less.  All of the popular/best-selling items are there, though.

There are several registers with roped off lines for each register.  I visited during a peak time, between noon and 1 on a weekday, and the scene was chaotic.  It was hard to tell who was in line waiting to order and who was standing around waiting for their order.  To lessen the confusion, perhaps they need a designated waiting area.

I ordered a Spicy Chicken Sandwich combo and the food and drink (sweet tea) tasted just as good as any other Chick-fil-A.  The only significant difference, other than this not being a standalone restaurant, was the rude service.  I saw one employee with a bad attitude get into it with another employee.  The downgrade in service is somewhat expected since the employees are serving primarily college kids, but I was a little surprised since Chick-fil-A is known for its outstanding and friendly service.

My order was filled quickly and the prices were in line with other CFA's.  Despite the service flaws, this place is a decent option for fast food on the Georgia Tech campus.  Note the limited hours, which are even more limited during the summer.",0.09815476190476188,Positive

I normally order the nuggets, spicy chicken sandwich, or cob salad. I recommend the chick-fil-a sauce and buffalo sauce for the nuggets.

1971,Chick-fil-A,1.0,"Absolutely the worst Chick-Fil-A in any city or state we have ever eaten in.  100% of the time we have to wait a very long time (30+minutes) after placing an online order to pick up curbside.  This is after about 30 minutes of waiting to even go there for the pickup.  

The absolute worst was that we ordered 26 chicken sandwiches to give out to friends when we were about to go out of town for two weeks.  We picked them up (after waiting curbside for at least 45 minutes past the time they were to be ready) and tried to eat ours (the chicken was tough, tasteless, and virtually indigestible), but had to throw ours away.  We contacted others, who said the same; most said the sandwiches were NOT prepared according to the order, and all were tasteless and inedible.  

We did this as we were leaving town for two weeks.  As soon as we returned, we kept the receipts, and called Guillermo, the manager.  He said, ""too bad"", we should have interrupted our trip to collect all 26 sandwiches and taken them in to the store, and then wait for them all to be remade.  He said that because we didn't do that, there was nothing they would do to make up for this.  

This cost us almost $200, and was all wasted.  We intentionally waited until mid-afternoon when they weren't  busy (there was only one or two cars there), and still had to wait.  Most of the sandwiches were unlabeled, almost all were done wrong (lettuce & tomato when none was requested, no cheese when cheese was ordered, no inner paper wrap on sandwich so it oozed all over the boxes), but we still waited about 45 minute.  This put us very behind, and we had to leave to go out of town.  

We will never go to this slipshod place again; I truly believe it is a health hazard, that they are not cooking the sandwiches properly, and follow no instructions.  

I strongly advise going elsewhere, or at least another location.",-0.28434343434343434,Negative

The first time I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and a large fries. The fries were pretty tasty for fries, better than most other fast food fries. The chicken sandwich was dry and dull, though, barely suitable for eating. 

The second time, I ordered their breakfast platter, and here is where I was especially disappointed. I was given the choice to substitute sausage for the eggs at no extra cost, since I can't eat eggs, but that was a mistake because the only thing even decent in the entire platter was the biscuit. The bacon was limp and gross, like eating stringy tendons. The sausage was hard and overcooked, almost like a piece of charcoal... both pieces were the same too, which says their stock of sausage is just bad. What few pieces of potatoes there were in the entire thing--like maybe four pieces--weren't half bad, but it doesn't make up for how garbage tasting the rest of it was. $4 down the drain. 

I wasn't expecting much, mind. It's fast food so it's not going to be all that great. But there's okay fast food and then there's terrible fast food, and this was pretty terrible.

Most egregious though was the wait times. Both times I waited almost ten minutes for my food, and both times they were tiny items that should not have taken anywhere near that long. As I said at the beginning I work in fast food so I understand sometimes longer wait times do happen, because they have to fry something for the order because they don't have it ready, or because their line person is in the middle of prep and has to finish something first before they can get back to the line, but there was just no excuse for it either of these times. I was just left waiting pointlessly.

The wait inside the restaurant was short and everything was very clean. The tables, drink and condiment station, and the floors too. The food however was another story!

The fiery chicken sandwich wasn't spicy, except for the jalepenos. The sandwich itself is supposed to be their spicy chicken sandwich which means it is a spicy chicken patty with pepper jack cheese. There was no spice aside from the jalepenos. It was not what I expected at all as it was the wrong type of cheese and the chicken had no spicy flavoring or taste. Fries were thin but fresh and my favorite part. The cookie was warm and chewy.

 We went into the restaurant at about 2:30 in the afternoon. There was one other customer in the place.  The person who took our order was cordial and friendly.  Very nice, until I saw her wipe her nose with her bare hand.  Apparently she didn't see her action as something that required a thorough hand washing afterwards.  A few minutes later, with those unwashed hands, she delivered our meal to our table.  Eww.  Cringeworthy, to say the least.

We had selected the cleanest of the tables in the dining room-- all of which needed a cleaning, as did the benches for said tables.  There were obvious crumbs and sticky spots on them. 

My cheeseburger was okay tasting, as was my husband´s chicken sandwich.  Nothing special.

But... afterwards, we each visited the restroom to wash our hands.  In the ladies restroom, the soap dispenser practically blasted the stuff out.

What I end up getting is excellent experiences each and every time I've been there, very tasty food, and they've been consistent on quality and delivery.  Maybe it's a timing thing as I usually go late night and it's been the same manager / drive-thru guy each time - - but I really have nothing to complain about.  

First visit they had a double cheeseburger combo special, and  I also noticed they had a spicy chicken sandwich on their value meal so I threw one of those in (someone has to compare the competition).  The order taker then says to me:  ""it will be about 3 minutes on that chicken sandwich - - is that okay?"".  I told him no problem - - at least it's good to know that they're making it fresh now and it wasn't sitting in a warmer.  

I do wait those entire 3 minutes, but my meal was pretty darn good.  I was very happy with the quality, char-broiled beef, and the french fries were hot and tasty.  This was a refreshing change of pace to the Mickey D's, BK's and Wendy's of the world, and the quality is definitely a slight notch better.  I'm also impressed with the portions - which are nominal for what I paid as opposed to seeing the beef patties and burgers at Mickey D's and BK's get smaller and shrink over time.  Oh - the Spicy Chicken Sandwich beats the competition, a notch better for sure.  A distant second place = Wendy's, then Mickey D's.  I also love how they have both red and white onions, and they'll do both for you onion freaks.  

I held off on the initial review so I could go back and see if they were consistent, and sure enough each visit resulted in the same great experience - - a hot and tasty grilled burger with fresh french fries and friendly customer service.  I gotta give credit where credit is due, but maybe the night shift has their act together?  They're open till midnight or 1am on weekends, and I finally tried the Memphis BBQ Burger (pulled pork + burger + fried onions) and was quite impressed, it was very flavorful, hot, and fresh.  

So I remain a Carl Jr's fan as I've been very pleased with every experience so far.  I have yet to try out any breakfast items or head there during the day time, but all I can say is the night shift has been all good in the Carl Jr's Hood.",0.16000807102502013,Positive

Yesterday, I ordered three chicken sandwiches: 2 for $5.55 charbroiled BBQ chicken and 1 charbroiled Santa Fe chicken. I asked for the Santa Fe to be a combo, with criscut fries and Coke Zero. The ONLY thing accurate about my order was the Coke Zero. I paid for everything, only to get home and realize they had given me only two sandwiches and regular fries. I got one BBQ and one Santa Fe, but it was not the Santa Fe advertised. Instead, it had somehow become a lesser chicken sandwich (I don't know if they thought I wanted it as one of the $5.55 sandwiches, but I paid for all 3...). At this point, it's not even worth it to go back and get the last sandwich that I paid for, because it would probably be wrong again.

I absolutely hate mayonnaise and always order my sandwich without it. When it gets left on, there's no way to rectify the error, as it soaks through the bun. Most restaurants (actual restaurants; Carl's is the only fast food place I visit) get this part of my order right about half the time. Carl's on 82nd and Powell is roughly 25 for 25 on getting my order right. That scores big points with me.

When I got to the window I started to remember how I've never liked the buttermilk meal.

I'm home. First bite I'm like...this is horrible. Memory refreshed.

In the world of fast food, McDonalds is King. And in the world of McDonalds, this location is the Jester.

It is horrendous. Unfortunately, it is the one closest (and conveniently 5 minutes away from) where we live and we have visited on occasion. Only once, ONCE have they gotten our order entirely correct and actually produced what seemed like hot, fresh food. 

On all other visits, we have either gotten soggy fries, burgers that felt like they'd been reheated on their little pans five times and then run over by a truck, and then reheated again on the pavement in parking lot, drinks that are dripping sticky soda down the side of the not-even-filled cup and orders that were completely wrong-o.

On our most recent trip, we ordered this (and this is getting personal now, disclosing my usual McDonalds order to the public, I feel like this is personal information):
1 Small Sweet Tea (she proceeded to convince us to order a large, since it is still 1$)
1 Large Fry
2 Double Cheeseburgers
2 4 pc Nuggets
Sweet and Sour Sauce
BBQ Sauce
1 McChicken

She displayed the order on the screen, proceeded to read the order back and it was fine.

We pull up to the next window, pay. 

We pull up to the next, next window and are handed our large drink. ""It looks orange, eew!"" I state, thinking that sweet tea would be a little more brown than that. But honestly, this is McDonalds, and nothing here is real, and I don't doubt for a minute that their sweet tea is orange, so I don't think much of it, other than wondering what the heck it tastes like.

We get our bag and drive off. Everything looks to be in order after a quick glance, 2 burgers, 1 chicken sandwich, 2 4 pc nuggets, fries.

Well, upon closer inspection once we got home, this is what we got:
1 Large Hi-C (explains the orange)
2 4 pc Nuggets (the only thing they got right)
2 Sweet and Sour sauce (no BBQ!)
1 McChicken (oh, sorry, they got this right, too)
2 McDoubles with no onions (didn't say no onions and McDoubles are different than Double Cheeseburgers)

We got a completely different order from what we stated and what was displayed and read back to us. I don't get it. My husband pointed out that the car behind us was still at the window when we hit the road, and our creeping suspicion is that they mixed our bags up.

The funny thing was, the orders were so close, and could sound so similar. But at the end of the day, they were plain wrong. And I don't understand how you mess this up? No offense to anyone in the fast food industry, but whenever this happens, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""and this is why they work at McDonalds"".

There's no problems until another staff approached me saying ""what's the problem , let me see it?"" I told her the manager took it already and she her tone was obnoxious.

2036,McDonald's,5.0,"As a couple of Canadians visiting Orlando, we did not expect to encounter the world's biggest Mcdonalds right down the street from our hotel. Once we found out how big it was, we dashed to it after our long day at Universal Studios.

 Let me tell you, this McDonalds was indeed large. The building consisted of multiple stories/levels, and the food selection was vast. 

They had your typical mcburgers, mcnuggets, etc., but they also served waffles, pasta (with an exclusive white sauce, only offered at that particular location), oven-made pizza like back in the 90's, and an array of desserts consisting of: cakes, pies, build-your-own Ice cream, etc. It was truly a spectacular sight for all the foodies out there, such as ourselves.

So my boyfriend and I ordered two buttermilk chicken sandwiches, and made it a combo with fries. We poured our drinks from the super-cool drink fountain which had basically every drink you can fathom. I tried the lime fanta, which was ok. Though, the buttermilk chicken sandwiches were absolutely delectable! Literally the best Mcdonalds burgers/meal we have ever had. The sandwhiches were very fresh and warm with steam coming out of the bites of chicken. The chicken piece was huge, like two normal sized chicken pieces in a sandwhich, and it was very moist and juicy. The bun was a wonderful potato bun with a butter glaze ontop. The sauce had a prominent buttermilk taste to it, as suggested by the name, the burger was well-presented and definately not sloppily assembled. 

Overall, the buttermilk chicken sandwhich from that Mcdonalds location was a solid 5/5, and I recommend you all to try that sandwhich from that particular location.",0.07238095238095237,Positive

From the original McDonald's menu, u can create your own burger or chicken sandwich. That was nice. They also have a fresh pizza and pasta station.... What?! Not at McDonald's?! Yes it's true. The chefs (yes, chefs) cook the pizza in a coal burning oven and make the pasta in front of you. We were impressed. Not enough to give it a try tho lol. 
The only negatives are the new ordering system. You don't order thru a person. They have large touch screen ordering to speed up orders and a do it yourself way to pay. To me it takes the customer service out of ordering and the touch screen kept having issues to where we had to use a different one.

Recently my son called me on the way home and asked me to pick him up some McNuggets and I thought how good a chicken sandwich would be right now. As I was going through the drive-thru I remembered a ad that I had heard on TV about chicken sandwiches being 2 for 6. I pull up to the drive-thru and asked the voice in the loudspeaker for the special and he said that they do not have that special. I said fine and just ordered my son's McNuggets value meal. I went home and noticed that the fries in his value meal were all at the bottom of the bag. I've been notice that there wasn't even a fry box or container in the bag at all. It was as if someone just dump some fries in the bottom of the bag. To top it off, as I sat down to relax for the evening I noticed the McDonald's commercial advertising the two for six chicken sandwiches.

2041,McDonald's,1.0,"I really wanted my first Yelp review to be of a fast food chain establishment. Just because. So here it goes.

Let me set the stage: it's 10:30PM, on a Thursday night, and I've spent the last few hours trying to convince myself that I'm not hungry enough for dinner. But at this very moment, I've finally snapped. Inconveniently, every place around me that offers a quick bite is now closed. So, I turn to the friend that is always there (or so I thought), McDonald's.

I pull up to the drive-thru window and place my normal order (Sweet Chili Chicken McWrap + large fry). In my desperate hunger, I also throw in the Artisan Chicken sandwich that is taunting me from the menu. There is some trouble relaying the order, but I think nothing else of it.

I pull forward to the pickup window (there are no other cars in line at this hour), and proceed to wait 5 minutes. Finally, the gentleman who took my order, who appears to be very high, comes to the window and tries to give me the wrong order (someone had pulled up behind me at this point). I send it back. Another 10 minutes pass by, and finally what appears to be a manager gives me my order. I'm a relatively patient guy, but waiting 15 minutes in McDonald's drive-thru is a little much I think. Anyways, I start eating my fries and begin the quick journey home, thinking that my trying times had passed.

When I got home, what awaited me in that McDonald's bag was the most bizarre order I'd ever seen in my life. At first, I popped open the premium sandwich box where the Artisan Chicken Sandwich was supposed to reside, and found two chicken breasts. That's it. No bun. No lettuce. No tomato. Just two chicken breasts. Which is one more than you're supposed to receive. I wondered who put this together and thought they were doing a good job. I mean, I appreciate McDonald's trying to watch out for my figure, but this isn't the time.

I reach further into the bag, and find some sort of weird-looking cookie that I neither wanted nor ordered. I throw that to the side.

Finally I found the McWrap, quickly ripping open the box only to find that it was wrapped in the stalest tortilla that I have ever felt.

Questioning the integrity of the entire meal at this point, I threw everything away, stormed off to bed, and buried my head in my pillows, just a touch less hangry than I was before this entire ordeal. Thanks a lot for nothing, Commerce Dr. McDonald's.",-0.06410430839002267,Negative

2045,McDonald's,1.0,"This is the only McDonald's near my work and probably for everyone else unless you you drive south into DT Portland or go across the bridge. Tried to give this place a chance after a couple of screw ups but I just can't do it anymore. And here's why.

One, look at the storefront photo. I uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year (mainly because I had another bad experience and I need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suck.)

So the first time, as the photo shows, a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I usually order it without mayo and when I got my sandwich the 1st time, guess what? It had mayo. I just don't get why they can't read instructions properly or anything. Why can't the condiment be separate and not default? It's so frustrating. Any way, 2nd time I got the sandwich, they ""got it right"" except for the fly part. I already went in my car so I said ""F it"" so I just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettuce.

I didn't go to this location for awhile after this incident, but I was craving Chicken McNuggets and so since it isn't a fresh produce item or whatever, I decided it wouldn't be a big deal. Boy was I wrong. I think this might have happened twice but I counted my nuggets and it was missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal. I shouldn't have to count how many nuggets I have, but sadly these people can't do their job. I don't even get much time to eat lunch so I didn't have time to go back and complain. I'm done with this location any way so if I'm craving a sandwich or Chicken McNuggets from here, I'll just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isn't crap like this location. They know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job. The fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on Large Fries. The best place for that would be the Beaverton location near Uwajimaya off highway 10 (I think that's it.)

We knew it was going to be a memorable experience when we used the drive-thru at 1:00AM (it was the only fast food joint that was near us and we were extremely hungry) and the woman over the intercom gave us an attitude when we were deciding on what to get. ""WHAT did you want?"" She was apparently in a rush to... I don't know, maybe get her nails or hair done while on graveyard shift??

We ordered the Premium Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich, she repeated our order over the intercom. Great! Nothing is missing and it's just what we ordered.

Wrong. WRONG! This is McDonald's Sandy Springs we're talking about. I'm currently typing up the 90th one star review, what did you expect? This restaurant has its own sub thread on the app NextDoor! It's that infamous.

Once we received our orders, about 15 minutes later. I double checked the bag. All the correct boxes were there. There was an extra box of fries that we didn't order originally but was added to our bill for whatever reason (????). Thumbs up for the unwanted add-on, folks.

We get home, open up the boxes and we realise the Premium Buttermilk Crispy Chicken didn't look right. I'm halfway into eating this sandwich and it didn't taste right either. This imposter was definitely sitting in the right box but since when did the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken have shredded lettuce?

Then it clicked: the staff intentionally, out of pure laziness took a McChicken and placed it into a Buttermilk Crispy Chicken box. It took them 15 minutes to concoct this plan? They could've said ""Hey, we ran out"", ""Hey, we're too lazy to fry this"" or ""Hey, we spent 15 minutes not working and this is what we could come up with. Let me refund you your money.""

But this, this was intentional with the intent to defraud.
This was definitely one of the most disappointing experiences I've had at ANY McDonalds (domestically and internationally).

This is normal routine at this point. If you place 10 orders, 9 of them are wrong. It's just sad. When I'm not strapped for time, I will drive 2 extra miles out of my way just to goto another McDonald's because they are that big of screw ups. 

So what prompted me to write this review? Like I said, I'm pretty much used to there crappy service at this point. So I goto this garbage location on a quick late night snack. I order a crispy chicken deluxe meal with a sweet tea. Pretty simple right? I don't listen to loud music. I speak perfectly clear English. I don't ask for anything special. Just the way it comes. Simple. 

I check the bag really quick before I leave because I know how big of screw ups they are. Quick glance everything looks good. I  see fries, I see a box that says crispy chicken sandwich. I have my large ice tea. We're in business right? Wrong, I get home and what do I have? Two pieces of bread with a chicken patty! No mayo, no lettuce, no tomato, no cheese. Nothing. Just bread and a chicken patty. I mean how bad can you get. Do I literally have to check my sandwich and dissect it before I leave? It's a joke. Talking to the manager is a waste of time. All you get is, want me to remake it?

2062,McDonald's,5.0,"Went there saturday night after finding out all kfc-es close at 11. dang! so not sure what to get cause i had my heart set out on chicken but finally ended up with the southern style chicken combo.

i normally ask a lot of questions but the person taking the order, want to say Alfredo, was super nice and helpful. Answered all my questions and made my sandwich perfectly. When I pulled up to the window to pay, I was informed that it would be 5 minutes and asked if that was ok. Since I was not in a rush, I said sure but that I wanted my drink when they brought out the burger/fries. The attendant then told me not to worry, I could have one now and that he'd bring me another on the house when my food was ready. Score! So for that alone, they get five stars. Its late on a saturday night, 20 min before closing, they've been dealing with brats all day, they probably want to go home and relax, heck some of the machines are already being turned off and cleaned, and yet they still treated me well and threw in a drink in order to keep me happy. that was just all around good service.


I almost docked half a star because the drive thru menu was so blah and looked like it had very few options. Mind you, I had just driven by taco bell, jack in the crack (gf wanted a chicken sandwich from there) and at least 2kfc-es, 1 wendys, arbys, and 2 chick-fil-ets with awesome menu displays.  I had quite a selection of menus in 45min and McDs was by far the most pitiful.

2063,McDonald's,1.0,"I came here 2 days ago just yesterday morning (Sunday) on our family road trip up to Seattle.  Being on a busy driving schedule, we did the drive-thru, but was greatly disappointed at what I got.

I think I made a simple order - 2 McChicken sandwiches with no mayo for myself and an Oreo McFlurry for my son, and a cup of water.  I have ordered McChicken sandwiches with no mayo at countless McDonalds for the last 10 years across the US, and they get it right about 95%+ of the time.

This time, however, as I started munching on the sandwiches while continuing our drive up I-5, we noticed that BOTH sandwiches not only missed the NO mayo request, but BOTH sandwiches had DOUBLE mayo, both on top and below the chicken patty.  Instead of a NO mayo option, I ended up with a QUADRUPLE mayo-portions for the day.  It was too late to go back and complain and request a correction.   I was too hungry too, so I just ate them both, but felt my heart clogging up for the rest of the afternoon.

My order did show up correct on the order confirmation screen in the Drive-Thru window, and the order did print up correctly on my receipt, but the totally incorrect product turned up in my bag unfortunately.  I'll call the feedback number on the receipt to report the incident so they can hopefully figure out where they went wrong.

I believe the rest of their operations is probably good, but I am commenting on my specific incident here, which was my only visit to this McDonald's.",0.03035714285714286,Positive

#11 Value Meal (Fish Fillet) - with a Sprite
Grilled Chicken Sandwich, no Mayo, Large Diet Coke

They confirm the order, we pay and pull forward...""Just Jack"" wannabe hands us the gigantic Diet Coke, and a bag of food. We patiently wait for the Sprite and he tells us NO, it isn't on the order. We say yes, it is, he then argues with us for 3 solid mins, even going so far as to try to spin the order monitor towards us so we can see for ourselves. He keeps harping that they didn't charge us for it. 

I'm not sure how many times we had to tell him that we were still missing a beverage, but finally, he huffed, and said that's $1.

I'm pretty certain he pocketed the money.

Fries are old, cold and mostly soggy

The other night I had to pick up my kid super late from the airport (her flight was delayed multiple times. It was past midnight and she was starving when she finally arrived). Because none of the food I had at home sounded good to her (!), I offered to drive through a Mickey D's to get her whatever she wanted. Her eyes lit up like firecrackers on the 4th of July. (Neither she nor I ever go to McDonald's, ever, but these were special circumstances).

We initially tried to go through the drive-thru at the McD just west of this one, on Marine Dr. SW (west of Cambie Street). Seems that McDonalds was undergoing some renovations and wasn't open (other drivers also pulled into the drive-thru here only to immediately drive away to this other McD a few blocks east. We were all part of a casual convoy together. lol). 

I've not been to a McD for years, so I was really impressed with this place (as was my kid). The menu offered a ton of choices. I liked that they offered breakfast foods all day long. All of a sudden, I had a hankering for an Egg McMuffin and a hash brown. (Don't judge! It had been at least 5 years since I've had this stuff). My kid ordered a grilled chicken ""burger"" with tomato and mozzarella and a mini-McFlurry. 

The guy at the window was super nice, our order came out fast, our order was perfect (no incorrect or missing items in the bag), and the food was actually really good and fresh. Yes, I said it. It was good. My hash brown wasn't greasy in the least (surprisingly), and the Egg McMuffin was great. My kid was in heaven (granted, she was really hungry.

2087,McDonald's,3.0,"It's a modern McDonald's. Go in at a peak time and order a typical menu item, and it appears just like that (like ordering a sausage mcmuffin during breakfast hours). Go in at an off time and order a grilled chicken item, and it takes a little time - because they are making it to order. Both of these speeds are good - fast breakfast when you just want to get in and get out, and a chicken sandwich made to order.

It's been ages since I've eaten at McDonald's and their fries still taste the same. Wait. no.. these were saltier? maybe they've always been this salty.

The only reason I came here is that there really are very little cheap dining options around the east end of the convention center, and this is the only fast food option. Otherwise you've got Denny's, IHOP, Red Lobster, and hotel restaurants ($$). Orlando, you could probably add another fast food/quick serve eatery in this area.

2092,McDonald's,1.0,"Every so often,  I find myself in situations which seem like they could have been lifted, whole cloth, from ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"".  My latest visit to this McDonald's location was one of them.

I grabbed a bite to eat at this location earlier this evening before catching a band at the Middle East.  I brought a McD's coupon from last Sunday's paper with me.  The coupon entitled the bearer to one free ""Regular Menu Sandwich"" with the purchase of a ""Regular Menu Sandwich.""

I thought I pass on the Big Macs and try two Crispy Chicken Ranch BLT sandwiches.  I placed my order and handed my coupon to the cashier, who also happened to be the manager on duty.

At first, he refused to honor the coupon for this particular order.  He pointed to the photo of the angus beef burger on the coupon and said that this coupon is for ""beef.""

I explained that the couple is ""buy one, get one"" on any ""regular menu sandwich.""  He again repeated that the coupon is for ""beef"" only.

I told him that McDonald's offers around 20 different sandwiches and they couldn't put pictures of all of them on a small coupon.  

He relented and honored the coupon, but from his words and tone of voice, it seemed clear that he didn't believe me and felt that he was doing me a favor by bending the rules and honoring the coupon on the chicken sandwiches.

He said that he would honor the coupon, but it would be different if I came in with that coupon tomorrow (Of course, it would be different.  I'd likely get a cashier who understood the offer and would honor it without argument or question).

Now, the backdrop to this transaction is that it seemed fairly clear that the manager/cashier was not a native English speaker.  While he spoke quite clearly, I suspect that his English reading skills are not quite the equal of his speaking skills.

Given the ethnically diverse workforce in the service industry, it would behoove McDonald's to briefly explain (and translate the verbiage, if need be) new coupon offers to their employees when they're distributed, so that awkward situations like this can be avoided.",-0.03203463203463203,Negative

I wait, wait, wait, then finally get my bag. The cashier snatches it back and says I dont remember you placing an order.... k.... so i told her what i ordered, my strawberry shake is already in hand. She says ""oh sorry"".... so i get home and open the box that the chicken sandwich comes in, and inside the box is a little @$$ cheeseburger. k, so i look at my receipt and not only does it say grilled chicken sandwich, I WAS OVER CHARGED TOO... So i go back, cheeseburger in hand, explain that its not what i ordered and i was over charged. They disputed the charged (it was only a dollar or so) so i said whatever... BUT GIVE ME MY CHICKEN SANDWICH? They TAKE BACK the burger (and put it in the back, somebody else must be eating it now) and in less than 30 seconds is a grilled chicken sandwich in a new box. the cashier rolls her little eyes and said ""your sandwich"".....

2097,McDonald's,4.0,"This McDonald's location is convenient for me since it is on my way to work. I usually order at the drive thru and purchase a Sausage and Egg McMuffin for my morning commute. This last time I visited here, I had my meal in the dining room. I ordered the Grilled Artisan Chicken sandwich, which was really good. A drink and French fries also come with the meal ( You HAVE to order the fries at McDonald's! I think there is actually a law somewhere in the books that says this is mandatory! ) My total came to $7.44.
Anyway, the dining area is always clean, as well as the bathrooms. The employees are friendly, helpful, and courteous. And every time I order from the drive thru window, I can actually understand the person working the window! I don't know how many times I go to a drive thru at other fast food places, only to ask the person to repeat what they said.
And like other McDonald's, this location has a playground.
Why McDonald's did not have playgrounds when I was a child is beyond me. I'm envious. Even pissed!
But I'll forgive them. Anyway, a good place to bring the kids. Especially for this neighborhood. And a convenient location, with Publix, CVS, Walgreens, and several other stores nearby. As well as a public school just down the street.
Coupons were given to me at the time of purchase, and this McDonald's is having a special through July 4, with $5 Meal Deals for lunch and dinner ( Sandwich with medium fries and a drink ).
My orders are always served fresh and hot, friendly service, and a great location. Especially for the intersection of Conway and Hoffner.

The quality of the food and service here isn't even worth the $1.08 you can pay for a chicken sandwich. So to help you out, I've compiled a list of the DO's and DON'T's at this location.

Here are the don'ts:

DON'T plan to pay with a card after 1am. For some magical reason they only accept cash between 1am and 6am EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. 

DON'T even worry about your order being correct after 11pm. The ""idgaf"" crew comes in around that time.

DON'T even worry about complaining to the manager. Tried that and she turned up on us for having a complaint.

DON'T write corporate telling them about how horrible your experience was- they'll send you an email telling you they appreciate your feedback. But I can assure you nothing changes about the location.

We went here with a couple of our friends for a ""quick"" breakfast back in August, and it took nearly 30 minutes to get four no-special-order breakfasts to go with drinks. The crew was non-appologetic about the wait. And after we left we realized they had gotten one of the orders wrong. I guess we rushed them...

Yesterday we figured we would give them another chance and stopped for a quick snack. It took them 10 minutes to produce a chicken sandwich, Fountain drink, and coffee.  They were out of coffee and didn't seem to know how to brew more (it took two crew members to figure it out). That wasn't even most of the cause of the delay,the crew was too busy standing around to bother bagging the items as they were cooked,they let them sit under the heart lamps for a few minutes first. Again no apology (except for the coffee) even from the manager who strolled by while we were waiting for the coffee.

Baby K loves Happy Meals, of course.  And it's nice to have some healthy options, at least for her: apple slices and milk in addition to fries (Dada usually ends up eating the burger or nuggets.)  

Sweetie had a Filet O Fish.  Decent, hot, tasty.  I had a crispy chicken sandwich.  Okay bun, meh meat, surprisingly fresh tomatoes and lettuce.  Forgettable.  And of course, fries.  I don't know what it is, the saltiness or the crispiness ratio, but they do fries right.

I guess that I can call it ""MY"" McDonald's for two reasons. One, I frequent this McDonald's more than any other and two, it's the closest one to my house. Does that qualify? I'm still waiting to hear back from their Ad Executives on this one.

I usually take advantage of their flawless and very quick drive-thru service. My favorite meal is their Steak and Bagel Breakfast Sandwich. Man, is that steak good and peppery - just the way I like it! The hash browns are the perfect compliment along with a hot cup of coffee, of course.

For lunch, I prefer a cheap double cheeseburger (or two). It's only $1 and it's filling. I also prefer their Grilled Chicken Sandwich. It's quite healthy compared to most of the other choices. It's served on a wheat bun and if you exclude the mayonnaise, you've got a very low calorie meal. For dinner, if I'm hungry (and naughty) enough, I'll order the Double Quarter Pounder w/Cheese Meal.

Well, this particular McDonald's will tend to pretty intermittently deliver some (or one) of those things. 

The interior has been spruced up a bit and features improved decor with local landmarks displayed, better and fancier looking seating, and crayons and other kiddie activities at every table. WiFi is free and available and easy to access. 

They also recently got two ordering kiosks where you can order and pay with no human interaction at all until a human brings the food right to your table!

The staff here tend to be very consistently marginal at best. You'll almost never get a friendly greeting or a genuine thanks. The ones working the drive thru always seem to be the worst. 

They have a large self service drink station (no coca-cola freestyle) which is always dirty, and there is always yucky ketchup spilled around the trash and ketchup dispenser. 

The food is... well... McDonald's. You can easily eat a meal here for $3 if you're not too picky about quality. They have developed some higher end beef and chicken sandwiches which are actually of good quality, but they aren't cheap anymore.  

I sometimes get a craving for their simple, cheap hamburger and will indulge myself. I know it's low quality with frozen beef on a very sad looking bun. But, sometime I just have a craving for one! It's been consistently the same for as long as I can remember. Similarly, I sometimes get a craving for their famous fries.

When I saw the sign that they would be installing a new McDonald's at this location (cambie and 12th), very close to my apartment, I cringed with hatred.  Mcdonald's brings out the nasty, gluttonous, fat mongering North American in me and I can't stand it.  

Grow some will power you say?  We'll unfortunately I can't seem to do that.  Every time I order food here I start eating and scoff to myself at how disgusting it tastes and question myself for even coming there.

I switch between 3 combos that I order; the mc-chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets and a double cheeseburger.  All contain a disgusting amount of calories and fat.

I almost went ahead and checked the YES box for DELIVERS in the business survey questions portion of this review, because YES, this Mickey Dee's does DELIVER!

Now let me tell you why. Three words: WALK-UP WINDOW (well, one of them is hyphenated, so does that still count as two separate words?). I can't believe the first reviewer didn't cover this! Sure, we all know the food is cheap, and this is where the homeless nest, but now I have to point on the convenience and second guess my word count??? That's a lot of pressure!

Anyway, I must say that walk-up window is clutch on a late Friday or Saturday night. It's fun too, because you never know who's going to be in line. It could be that hot chick that was grinding on you at Ringler's...and her cheap boyfriend. I also find it amusing in my drunken state to heckle the people in the drive-thru. Usually I challenge their toughness and confidence, because whilst they hide inside their little minivans and station wagons, I'm outside dealing with the elements and openly displaying my love for Ronald and all his glory.

So to the dancefloor fox with the undeserving hound, bilamos mi amor. I wish I was the one buying you Filet-O-Fish sandwiches. 

And to all the drunken Beaverton residents I've met who missed the last MAX to Hillsboro and now have to walk over the West Hills (cuz you can't drive), you're doing the right thing. You're gonna need those nutrients before you make that trek. 

And to all the snooty NW residents passing by who can't accept that they live in a neighborhood with a McDonald's, just get over it.

2136,McDonald's,1.0,"Sometimes you just can't go back in time. 

I went to this McDonald's after not going to any McDonald's restaurant for a long, long time. 

In fact, I was so dazed by my visit that I accidentally affixed this review to a McDonald's that used to exist down the street and has since closed. So, now I'm putting it where it belongs. And that's nowhere good.

Things have changed. Obviously, a lot of money and thought went into the decor, but they overthought it. The menu is now on an LCD display so that it's super-bright to the point where it makes the menu hard to read. If you're going to use a bright white background, then you should make the letters more bold so that the lettering doesn't get washed out. 

The guy behind the counter was fantastic. He seemed more like the manager, and he was doing his best to make things move along. 

So, why the single star? Because the food was awful. Seriously awful. 

McDonald's spent a lot of money advertising that they are now serving fresh beef burgers. But the problem is that people who go to McDonald's eat their food so fast that what we're looking for is a bold dash of flavor. If I were slowly chewing my food there, then the new burger probably tastes better than the old ones. But when you're rushing to eat, the new burger is kind of tasteless. 

The other problem is that all of their food was barely warm. I'm not sure how that happens, but the fries, the burger, and the buttermilk chicken sandwich all were barely warm. How do I know? Because when I unwrapped the Quarter Pounder with cheese, the cheese was cold. I'm not talking warm. I mean that it was cold and completely happy sitting in the exact same shape it was in when it was hanging out in their refrigerator. 

The Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich was awful. It wasn't just that they served it with no bottom part of the bun. No joke, when my friend opened the top to lift it out, we were both shocked that there was only the top part of the bun, then the mayo, lettuce and slice of tomato, and that was it. And so when she lifted it out, she immediately realized that the temperature of the chicken was cool, not even warm. 

The chicken itself looked like real chicken, so that was nice. But the taste was bland. It also didn't help that she ordered Buttermilk Chicken Tenders and got a sandwich instead. But at that point, we were so disappointed in the entire experience that we decided it wasn't worth complaining about, especially because the guy at the counter was so nice. I'm sure he gets hassled all day by customers yelling at him. 

The fries... Sweet mother of God, the fries weren't just cold. They were also tasteless. And to make the whole thing worse, I saw this dude, scoop the fries up with their little shovel spatula, dump it into the fries container, and then... no joke, he weighed it. 

What????????

If you go there, you'll see the little scale on the wall next to where they fryolater is. 

I'm not sure why that bothers me so much, because they do it elsewhere like at some ice cream places, but it just reeks of penny-pinching.

I have so many fond memories of McDonald's that it seriously pains me to write such a terrible review. But if this is the new direction, then I understand why there's been so much turmoil in the franchises. When I looked at the overall menu, it was just a lot, especially because now they have all-day breakfast. 

And I can't help but wonder if the menu overload combined with the fresh beef drive is slowing the workflow to the point where the food comes out cold in the end. 

Somehow I've never had a cold burger at Burger King, so I'm not sure why it happened at this McDonald's. And judging by previous reviews, this is a common occurrence.

Everyone in my complex that goes there jokes that you have to check the bag twice. If going through drive-through you MUST check your order. In the past I asked if they placed the apple pies in, they said yes and I took their words for it and drove away. Got home, no pies. I've asked for one boy toy meal and one girl toy meal and got two girl toys. I have asked for a plain burger, no meal- got the fries and no burger. Asked for a grilled chicken sandwich and got home with a burger. LOL.

They will correct the problem if you go back. The manager seems well aware of the issues. I have had family members visit who go in & brought the food home. The order was missing a few items, but they didn't want to go back. If you are able to check the bag right way, you can clear up the issues.

If you go during peak hours, know that the drive-through is a short line. So it will go into their parking. So if you park and go in, expect to stay a bit as you may get blocked in. Parking closer to the other business works out best. They share a parking lot with a Publix and other stores- so there are always spaces (maybe not close) but there. When you walk in they have a free for all order process. Great if slow, but if it's during their peak hours, know that if you get stuck in a slow cashier lane it's hard to jump to the faster one.

2167,McDonald's,3.0,"On my way to Curry Honda for my scheduled maintenance appointment, I went to the drive-thru of this McDonald's since it was so conveniently located almost adjacent to the Honda dealership.  It was around 1:45 pm on a Saturday afternoon, and there were probably only two cars in front of me, so I thought I'd be in and out of there quickly.  

What I thought would be a ""quick"" drive-thru took over ten minutes.  I'm not sure what the hold up was, but perhaps one (or both) of the cars in front of me got a large order.  All I ordered was a Spicy McChicken Sandwich, small fries, and a cup of ice water.

Again, Curry Honda is located super close to the McDonald's, so the food should have still been hot (or at least warm) when I got there.  However, when I sat down to eat my food in the waiting room, I noticed the sandwich and fries were barely warm, and the ice in my water was almost completely melted.  I guess the food had been cooked and sitting out for a while, and they must keep cups of ice water ready to hand out to customers.  Boo.  

It was my first time trying the Spicy McChicken Sandwich, and I thought it was decent.  It has a very slight kick of spice and is at least a little more interesting than the plain ol' McChicken Sandwich.

Overall, this McDonald's gets 3 stars for being ""OK.""  Yes, service could have been quicker, and the food should have been served hotter, but this is a McDonald's and at least the employees were friendly.  I may return to this McDonald's if I'm on my way to Curry Honda and didn't have time to grab food elsewhere, but it wouldn't be my top choice for fast food in the area.

2170,McDonald's,3.0,"Decided to drive thru after an evening out for the bestie to grab a drink. When we pulled up we were greeted by what I believed to be a pre recorded message asking we were interested in a chicken sandwich, I think, then like 2 more voices came over asking to take our order. The bestie decided on a large unsweet tea and an order of fries and in last minute decided to order an ice cream cone. We were given our totals and asked to pull around. When we pulled to the 1st window the order take was talking to their coworker and then gave is the total for the 1st order. She quickly ran his card and then stood there holding her hand out to take my money and then started taking an order from the speaker. I patiently waited for my change. When she finished with the order she apologized for the wait and gave me my change and receipt. 

When we pulled up to the 2nd window, I was handed the fries without a smile or hello and then she poured the tea and again handed it out to me and turned to go make my cone.

2174,McDonald's,1.0,"Note: this review was written for the McDonald's down the street and not this one because this one has been shut down for a while. But I can't figure out how to delete the review. 



Sometimes you just can't go back in time. 

I went to this McDonald's after not going to any McDonald's restaurant for a long, long time. 

Things have changed. Obviously, a lot of money and thought went into the decor, but they overthought it. The menu is now on an LCD display so that it's super-bright to the point where it makes the menu hard to read. If you're going to use a bright white background, then you should make the letters more bold so that the lettering doesn't get washed out. 

The guy behind the counter was fantastic. He seemed more like the manager, and he was doing his best to make things move along. 

So, why the single star? Because the food was awful. Seriously awful. 

McDonald's spent a lot of money advertising that they are now serving fresh beef burgers. But the problem is that people who go to McDonald's eat their food so fast that what we're looking for is a bold dash of flavor. If I were slowly chewing my food there, then the new burger probably tastes better than the old ones. But when you're rushing to eat, the new burger is kind of tasteless. 

The other problem is that all of their food was barely warm. I'm not sure how that happens, but the fries, the burger, and the buttermilk chicken sandwich all were barely warm. How do I know? Because when I unwrapped the Quarter Pounder with cheese, the cheese was cold. I'm not talking warm. I mean that it was cold and completely happy sitting in the exact same shape it was in when it was hanging out in their refrigerator. 

The Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich was awful. It wasn't just that they served it with no bottom part of the bun. No joke, when my friend opened the top to lift it out, we were both shocked that there was only the top part of the bun, then the mayo, lettuce and slice of tomato, and that was it. And so when she lifted it out, she immediately realized that the temperature of the chicken was cool, not even warm. 

The chicken itself looked like real chicken, so that was nice. But the taste was bland. It also didn't help that she ordered Buttermilk Chicken Tenders and got a sandwich instead. But at that point, we were so disappointed in the entire experience that we decided it wasn't worth complaining about, especially because the guy at the counter was so nice. I'm sure he gets hassled all day by customers yelling at him. 

The fries... Sweet mother of God, the fries weren't just cold. They were also tasteless. And to make the whole thing worse, I saw this dude, scoop the fries up with their little shovel spatula, dump it into the fries container, and then... no joke, he weighed it. 

What????????

If you go there, you'll see the little scale on the wall next to where they fryolater is. 

I'm not sure why that bothers me so much, because they do it elsewhere like at some ice cream places, but it just reeks of penny-pinching.

I have so many fond memories of McDonald's that it seriously pains me to write such a terrible review. But if this is the new direction, then I understand why there's been so much turmoil in the franchises. When I looked at the overall menu, it was just a lot, especially because now they have all-day breakfast. 

And I can't help but wonder if the menu overload combined with the fresh beef drive is slowing the workflow to the point where the food comes out cold in the end. 

Somehow I've never had a cold burger at Burger King, so I'm not sure why it happened at this McDonald's. And judging by previous reviews, this is a common occurrence.

2175,McDonald's,2.0,"Another tasty piece of crap? 
THE ""12"". Well the hype is on along with another flood of commercials for the new chicken sandwich. 
Ok, occasionally I eat at McDonald's just to fill my belly between meals, or even sometimes for something cheap to eat while I'm out! 
Overall, the burgers are just a piece of crap, but a TASTY piece of crap! Even though they taste like a warm soggy newspaper their still edible. 
I wrote in to comment once from reading the link on the back of the receipt; I said ""it's not meat"". Then maybe a week later they had a TV campaign boasting that it was real beef! eg. ""We're the meatballs your grandma makes, steak you cook on the grill"", etc, etc.

Ok, back to the 12: I ordered the 12 Grilled; and one or two bites in it tasted strange. Not like chicken but more like pork. But then I seen the meat was ""stringy"" like chicken is, but also so is rat meat! 
Even with the miracle of MEAT GLUE it still didn't quite taste or have the texture of chicken meat.
McDonald's food is processed to death; soaked in chemicals, all kinds of preservatives, and God knows what else. But the twelve is something else... Your guess is as good as mine! And why the name: ""THE 12""??? When it's for any time of the day.
My guess... It takes 12 Rats to get enough meat to make it (sorry rat lovers)! 

Dear McDonald's, Why not just make your burgers out of TOFU, if you're going to be cheap with the product you serve to customers! 
Stop lying and scamming fast food patrons around the world, and just say what your food is made of or has in it instead of making up stories???
In some parts of the world Rat, Dog, Cat, even possum and squirrel are a delicacy. 
It might have an effect if you tell people the truth, but you will still make money.

My recommendation... Eat at your own risk! 
Think about it... This is the restaurant that sells something called: the McWrap, ""Mc Crap"" they admit and market the fact it's crap.
BTW... What's with everyone giving them 3-3 1/2 stars??? Or is it McDonald's Corp paying to write the reviews!",-0.09691558441558443,Negative

The restaurant went through a huge transformation over the summer of 2011 and recently was finally finished.  I like the updated look but I also rarely eat in there and instead take everything to work.  I believe there is free wi-fi although don't quote me on that.  The flat screen TV's tuned to CNN most of the time are a nice touch.  4 stars instead of 3 BECAUSE of the remodel.  

The drive thru here is super impressive......they have a conveyor belt that sends the food to the other side of the restaurant from the kitchen.  This is crucial for the 24 late nights, I've been here before at 3 AM and the line can get ridiculous so efficiency is a must.  I also hate that they only have a ""late night menu"" and jack up their prices.  But if you're stupid enough to eat a Big Mac before bed when you're craving a Southwestern Style Chicken Sandwich that they might not offer instead, then there is no hope for you anyway.  

These reviews about getting the wrong change back are pretty ridiculous.  Only an idiot wouldn't actually count their change PRIOR to leaving a restaurant if you're unsure of it, or actually speak up to someone when it happens when caught.

I don't usually review fast food places unless there's an exceptional case--the food, environment, and servers are almost always the same across all fast food chains.  That said, this is probably one of the worst McDonalds I've been to.

A friend was hungry and wanted to grab something on our way downtown so we decided to stop at this McDonald's.  It's a ""McDonald's Classic"" which aims to recapture the original style and feel of the early McDonald's.  It has two drive throughs and no eat-in area, which leads you to (incorrectly) assume it might be aimed at being speedy.  Lies!  ALL LIES!

There was one car ahead of us in our line, and no one in the the other.  We sat at the ordering station for a good 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were there.  Our order (two McChicken sandwiches and two sweet teas) took over 10 minutes to come out.

The drive thru lady did not speak very good English and could barely understand me and to make matters worse, the amusement park directly behind the Restaurant was extremely loud and I'm pretty sure the noise through speaker must make taking orders difficult.

I ordered one Spicy chicken sandwich w/o lettuce and mayo only and added cheese. It was given to me completely plain. The grilled chicken sandwich was gummy and appeared undercooked. After arriving back to my hotel was when I noticed all of this and did not feel like going back especially with all the traffic on US-192.

2201,Burger King,2.0,"This burger king usually has some dirty tables, more then they should. The staff is kind of slow and more concerned with the drive thru.

The reason I write this review has to do with some thing that is common to all burger kings lately. It used to be you could get an original chicken sandwich, or a whopper pretty cheap.

But if you haven't noticed both cost $3.99, now I remember years ago the whoppers were .99 cents and were a decent size. But nowadays the size of all their pattie is noticeably smaller. Even the chicken sandwich is smaller and flat. Those used to burst in the middle and have a good amount of meat. Now they are flat.  If I had to guess they patties are 30% smaller across the board, you notice burger king never advertised their pattie size like McDonald's.

It's come to the point that you should never go to a BK without a coupon of some kind. At $4 bucks, you can hit up a steak and shake or even a 5 guys for a better burger or combo. Even McDonald's and Wendy's have better every day prices.",0.04722222222222222,Positive

Not cold, like the lettuce and tomatoes were refrigerated, but the meat was cold and the bun was cold and soggy.

They made us pull around and park up front even though there was no one else there, 17 minuets later we were brought our food but with onion rings instead of fries, we were told to wait a minute and they would bring back out fries. 10 minuets later we decided to go through the drive thru again to get the fries that they never brought out. During our wait through the drive thru (they were suddenly busy) I tasted my soda which was mostly soda water because they didn't check their syrup levels. When we made it to the window we waited for 2 minuets before someone opened it and talked to us, I asked for a replacement soda, sprite instead hoping that one would be okay. I was handed a root beer. Seriously? This location is a joke that has never done one thing right.

When we fought it up to him, he denied scratching his head before handling te order, implied it was only hot water in the bucket used to clean the floor near the drive thru, and be-little me on the BK practices of handwashing after 1)touching the face/hair, 2)refusing to rewash his hands after scrubbing te floor with a red towel, 3)refusal to reprint the most current receipt for our order.

2206,Burger King,2.0,"Not the worst Burger King I have eaten at, but definitely have had better food.

The food was mediocre with the original chicken sandwich being okay and the onion rings were kind of cold and rubbery (at least they didn't taste like burnt fry oil like at a couple of the Chicago Locations). the cinnamon roll thing was actually pretty good and a lot warmer than the sandwich or rings. And the fountain drink rootbeer tasted a bit off, like their mix was off a bit.

The restaurant was actually fairly clean for a Burger King, but they had buzz-in bathrooms and were having problems with them while I was there.

The service was friendly, but really unprofessional looking and they took quite a while filling my order (about 10 minutes, and it wasn't even a complicated order, an original chicken sandwich, medium, with a cinnamon roll, that was it, no special requests).

 My complain about this location is that the Drive thru was a bit slow but service was good even thought they forgot my orange juice, I parked as soon as i notice my orange juice missing and when i went up there the same guy from the drive thru notice me and knew something was wrong and he gave me my missing orange juice plus an extra one. 

My order was right except for the missing juice but they took a bit to get my order taken and to take my money and give me my food , even though i was in no rush i was surprised they were a bit slow but there was only one car ahead of me and he seemed like he had to wait a bit too. 

The staff was friendly and I had no problem getting the missing part to my order but over all for $5 bucks the breakfast menu is not worth it but the little you get for that amount I would of been more full with a whopper then a little chicken sandwich on a biscuit and a few tator tots even though the food was good and fresh.

I quickly placed the rest of my order and ducked off to the side.  So awkward.  There's an outdoor eating area where a playground used to be, but they've taken that out so there are only a few tables there now.  I suggested to Patrick that we eat out there so we didn't have to be inside with all of the other awkward people.  I felt much more safer because this area is barred off from the parking lot, so people couldn't bother us while we ate.  Thank God for Burger King's jail bars.

The drive-through is okay ... never had a problem with it. I guess it'd be hard to mess up anything that I've ordered here, since I almost always just get a chicken sandwich. I went through a Whopper-ordering phase in the late 90s or sometimes in the 2000s, but that now is over. If I ever have fast food (B.K., Wendy's, McD's, etc.), I just have a chicken sandwich. Sonic may be the exception, since I like its hamburgers.

Don't really have much to say about this place. I only go to it 2-3 times a year or whenever I am in the mood for its chicken sandwich, which does something for me. The chicken is tasty.

I politely corrected him and told him what I ordered, to which he gave a new total: $8+. Again, I gently reminded him of the items and told him it should be a little over $2. Finally, the amount was correct. 

I waited at the drive-thru window for-- no joke-- probably 10 minutes, before he pops his head back out and explains that they're short staffed and the cook hadn't dropped fries in the fryer. Would I mind some onion rings instead? Sure. No problem. ""What else did you order?"" A spicy chicken JR. Several more minutes goes by, he hands me a huge, heavy bag. Inside are multiple hamburgers and the onion rings. I'm all about karma, so I let him know that this must be someone else's order, and attempted to hand it back. ""What did you order again?"" The spicy chicken JR. Several more minutes, finally a chicken sandwich is given to me. He tells me to keep the burgers since I waited so long. And he gives me a large drink, too.

One guy is standing off to the side talking on his phone so I go past him and get in line. The lady at the front won't get off her phone long enough to give her order. When they give her exactly what she orders she admits she screwed up and asked for a different burger. The guy who was talking yelled that he would buy it cause he was in a hurry. So they let him skip ahead of all of us just to buy one cheese burger. When I finally get up I order a spicy chicken sandwich medium combo. When I get my food, which the people behind me got theirs before me BTW, the manager asks if I need ketchup. I said yes and he gingerly hands me two packets. Really!?!?!

2244,Burger King,2.0,"One-line review: Okay for fast food.

We came for the BK Big Fish (no longer available in the States, so we were surprised to find it here). It was... not as big as we remembered. We asked if they would fry our fish a bit longer to make it extra crispy, and they declined; but they did add lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle per our request.

My wife said the fries were not very good; my onion rings were fine, not great.

On the whole, it was a fairly average BK experience. Might have been happier with a Whopper.

They had a number of specials running: 2 bigger sandwiches (Whopper, BK Big Fish, or their chicken sandwich) for $7, 10 piece chicken nugget for $2.99, so that seems a decent value if you are set on fast food.

Service was adequate, not memorable. Parking was free in their lot.

2251,Burger King,3.0,"So I am writing a review about Burger King. Don't judge. This place has gotten me through three years of law school.

The staff here are super friendly, when they have every reason not to be. When you ask for condiments, they will give you a heaping handful. When you decide that you want an ordinary chicken sandwich, and then proceed to add all sorts of custom toppings, they will grin and bear it. (You didn't think you could change the sandwiches did you? Oh contrare!)

They take any coupon you throw at them, including ones you've found online that are not advertised as being accepted at their store. 

Cons:

No matter how clean it is here, it still looks dirty. I think it's the lighting. It is rather gloomy and yellow tinged. 

Homeless people everywhere. Also drunk people. And angry teenagers. And unhappy sorts of folk who yell at each other directly in front of the doorway. 

Anywhoo. If you are living off the fumes of your last paycheck, or are drunk and need grease. Go here. It's better then the McDonalds options in the area.",-0.12257575757575756,Negative
2252,Burger King,3.0,"To be fair, Downtown is always littered with beggars and some of the most RA (random a**) people that stream in from all over the greater metropolitan Boston area, so just coming to this part of the city is an adventure in and of itself. The restaurant seems to be slightly disorganized upon coming in. There is one cashier register that is by itself for whatever odd reason and may lead customers to think that a line should be formed there. Nope, you are lining up on the far left near the 2 cash registers that are off to the side. They were fairly quick and effective with taking my order for spicy nuggets, so I can't fault them for that. The nuggets are good but may catch some people by surprise considering how the spiciness catches you a second or two after consuming the nuggets. Overall, since you are in Downtown Boston, you have to expect some degree of seediness. If anything, they should prioritize organizing the lines better in order for people to know where to line up and where to go after their orders have been placed. Cleanliness isn't a real factor when you can (and should) order takeout. Overall, if you want food here, order on the go and just bounce.

Update: Ordered a spicy chicken sandwich out of curiosity. In a way, spicier than Wendy's but the sweet bun was a curious choice to complement the spicy chicken.

And i don't know how but we were walking in downtown Boston and she convince me just to have a small sandwich because we were very hungry but didn't had time to have nice meal. And i believe she was trying to  proof me that burger king food are not as bad as i am thinking. But this visit disappoint her as much as me.
I look at the menu and only one thing that i find i might like it was chicken sandwich because i hate the smell of burgers. Not the home made but in fast food stores they small as old and bad meat to me. Sorry for saying i know that lot's of people like it but not me!
My friend actually order some type of cheeseburger. The girl who was taking the order was talking too fast so it was hard to understand her so i decided to repeat the order but the girl seems like wasn't paying attention what i was saying and made such fast like she want us to leave as soon as possible, I'm really good with emotions: i mean when people think about something i can say just by looking on their face what their emotion are in that moment. Maybe i was wrong but that was my friend felt too so no respect for customers. Not good job
And as a result we got only one chicken sandwich  with $1 extra for one not fresh slice of tomatoes. Terrible and old taste coke for  $8.00 She didn't charge us for cheeseburger and i am pretty sure i told her. But i was really happy that we didn't get second meal because spend around $15 and get terrible food not for me. So we just share that small chicken sandwich.

2258,Burger King,1.0,"I've never been to such a huge dumpster fire of a fast food restaurant before in my life.

I sometimes go to fast food places because my dogs love nuggets. Yes I know I'm both a pushover and a bad dog father, but goddamnit they love their nuggies. So I indulge them once a week. I figured why not get a couple of my favorite childhood sandwiches as well?

I had actually been thinking about original chicken sandwiches lately. It's been a while, and I used to love them. Crispy, zesty, elongated, chicken sandwiches. Simple. Delicious.

When I got to the drive through, it took a bit for someone to speak. I don't know if you are supposed to speak first these days, so maybe that's my fault.

I stated that I wanted two original chicken sandwiches and the attendant said ""ok so 2 spicy crispy chicken sandwiches"" and I replied that what she responded was mistaken and that I wanted two plain regular ORIGINAL chicken sandwiches, to which she replied ""ok so two crispy chicken sandwiches"" to which I, a third time, said original chicken sandwich. I said we might be getting it mixed up and asked if there was a difference between crispy chicken, and original chicken, because they appear to be different items on the menu. They were. She then responded ""oh ok so you want three original chicken sandwiches.""

...just the two will be fine...

So after that she asks if I want anything else. More like she says ""...anythingelseforyou?"" So I ordered a side of fries and some mozzarella sticks. 

""2 chicken sandwiches and a fries. Anything else?""

""Yes the mozzarella sticks as well please, and two orders of chicken nuggets""

""...thatallforyou?""

I pull up, pay, make sure the items are correct on my receipt, good to go. I get the bag and drive off. I'm snacking on my fries on the way home, and realize the load is a bit small, so I pull over and inspect my bag, and notice no nuggets. UGH! So I head back.

I retrieve my nuggets, which came with a bonus taco, and finally make it home. 

I soothe my beasts with their nuggies, put away more for tomorrow, and sit down to eat my chicken sandwiches. I have been waiting for this moment. 

I open the wrapper, and...mold. There's mold on this bread. I'm in the restaurant industry, shit happens, so I go to tear off the bit with the mold, and upon touching it I realize it's all stale. My fingers graze the sides of the chicken patty, and it's soggy. I open the bun...and the lettuce is rotten.

Like...at this point...I have thoroughly died inside. How....like why the fuck....

Ok so if I were working there, and had fucked up interpreting this guys order three goddamn times, I'd want to make DAMN sure the rest of his order was right or at LEAST in the damn bags. You better BELIEVE I'm getting back into that line making sure those sandwiches are goddamn flawless, and you better fucking believe I'm in front of that monitor making sure EVERY GODDAMN ITEM makes it into the bag. Even if it was just to save my own integrity. 

I get it kids. It's not considered ""cool"" to work at a fast food place, of all times during the summer, of al times during the weekend. I get it, but while you are there, you need to be one hundred percent there. And this was not that.

Placing the order was no problem. When I got to the drive thru I told them I ordered through the app and they asked my name. Then they came back and asked me a second time for my name. I was then told to pull to the second window. Pretty standard so far. At the window I was told that they had discontinued the crispy tacos of which I had ordered three. I was informed that I shouldn't use the app to order as this type of thing happens on a regular basis. I asked what we were going to do then and the only option I was given was to get they're $1 chicken nuggets instead of the tacos. I wasn't giving any option for a refund or for any other product. As my children like the nuggets I said I would get the three orders because they would not go to waste. The rest of my order consisted of 2 chicken sandwiches and two small fries. I customized both sandwiches when I ordered. I had to wait on my order while they made the nuggets. When I got home and unpacked the order everything was there. I opened the first chicken sandwich and it was made wrong, so I opened the second one to discover it was also made wrong.

I asked the for 2 junior spicy chickens & 10 pc nugget , order taker decides to enter something totally different , when I said to her that not what I asked and pointed out to what I was referring from the king meal deal section , her answer "" ohh that's normally kids orders "" 

Since when are employee allowed to differentiate and make such comments ? 

While I was waiting for my order, another customers order was ready who was waiting in his car , the order taker was given the food pack and asked to go drop off to the customer because he was a GUY !

2279,Burger King,3.0,"First, I can't be a fan(atic) of a Burger King on a knee jerk level, so A-OK it is.

This store sits smack in the middle of McLoughlin Blvd.'s run between Milwaukie's old Main Street-like downtown and its intersection with I-205.  The store appears to have been modernized at some point over the years it has been there, and probably recently.  Here's the deal as to why I even stopped in.  If you want to slam dunk something along the lines of ""recession food"" down the hatch from Mickey D's, your choices are largely limited to generic hamburgers and their McChicken sandwich which, unfortunately, is Cajun flavored and not my thing.  On Fridays, select franchised locations are also offering up a Filet-O-Fish for a discounted price but I get hungry on days other than Friday.  There, I said it:  Filet-O-Fish.  Filet-O-Fish.  I said it again!

Enter Burger King.  For a while now, they have been selling 10 chicken nuggets for $1.49.  Now THAT's what I'm talkin' about!  It is now easy to defect from Mickey D's and head to BK when hunger pangs strike.

For this location:

Food - 3 stars - boilerplate Burger King

Locale and physical plant - 3.5 stars - way nicer than a BK one would expect to find in Milwaukie, Oregon

Service - 4 stars - the one and only time I've been in there, which is recently, the guy at the counter was very polite.

Because food counts for more when doing a weighted average, I give this Burger King in Milwaukie's Oak Grove section 3 stars.",0.0019047619047619054,Neutral

My husband thought to check again because they seemed to be in a rush to get out of there. Upon opening the sandwich we found it had been WIPED to get rid of the mayo and lettuce! There were remnants of mayo and lettuce on the chicken, both pieces of bread and inside the wrapper! At this point they had shit all the lights off and locked up so I pulled up next to the drive through window and beeped. Pam looked at me and rolled her eyes. I beeped three more times over a matter of 5 minutes, and no one came to the window.

2285,Burger King,2.0,"I wanted to write this review mainly to bring attention to the bizarre décor of this specific location, but I ended up having quite a telling experience during my recent visit. While nearly all chain restaurant locations are identical, this one is channeling a mid-90s formal dining room. I was sad to see that the portraits of smiling fruits and veggies that once adorned the walls are now gone, but the new drapes and wallpaper are nice. It just doesn't feel like a Burger King inside. It's rogue.

Anyway, I ordered inside, but the computer system was down. They couldn't process cards and their ordering system wasn't showing orders to the kitchen. While I wasn't in a hurry and they certainly weren't busy, the staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They acted like it was the end of the world. Someone dropped an f-bomb from out back. I was understanding of the computer glitch, but their behavior was unacceptable. I did appreciate the free small fry that they gave me while I waited for my sandwich though.The sandwich itself (tendergrill chicken sandwich) had too much mayo. When I got home, I added a heaping portion of spring mix to it to make it something a little more substantial. This is probably why I don't eat fast food often. It's a below average location, but I don't expect much from any fast food chain in general.",0.02570592286501379,Positive

And boy were they pissed. And off the mark. The fries given to us felt like they had been sitting outside in this 37 degree weather and we had to send my husbands sandwich back 4 times because he had asked for a tendercrisp chicken sandwich and they kept sending out whopper burgers.

So, it's clear from the laminated sign that that speaker has been broken for a while and an immediate repair isn't in the plans. That tells you that the owners just don't care about this place. 

When I pulled around to the window a very friendly woman greeted me and took my order. Problem was they didn't have a menu posted at the window, and I hadn't taken enough time to look at the sign before pulling forward. Kind of caught off guard I just ordered a chicken sandwich. She rattled off a bunch of chicken sandwich options and I just ordered the old-school one I was familiar with. I paid and was directed to pull around front and she would bring out my order. 

When I parked I noticed a group of men sitting in the shade at the front corner of the parking lot by the drive-thru. I don't know if they were homeless or what, but I kind of got a weird vibe from it.

Maybe the kids don't know any better.  The rest of the interior is nice and clean.

Staff were nice and quick with my order.

The chicken sandwiches (2 for $5 right now) really aren't anything special.  The meat is much too salty, and the only toppings are lettuce and mayo.  I had one of each (regular and spicy), and spicy just had an extra squirt of hot sauce.  The sandwiches are honestly quite sad looking.  See photo.

I'm not lying when I say it was probably 15 or more years!

I got the chicken sandwich, which was as good as I remember. I mean, I knew I was getting an old standby and not a gourmet chicken sandwich--a throwback to my youth. It was what it was, and it tasted fine. I couldn't bring myself to order fries, so instead I got chicken tenders as my side (not quite as bad, right?) =) They were tasty as well.

My only complain about this visit is that the service was slow. I realize it's an airport location and they have a crowd of people wanting some Whoppers. Nevertheless, the staff could definitely use a lesson on efficiency.

I asked about the ice, and was directed to the other machine.  That was empty as well.  I was told that there was no more ice.

I decided to get a refund as this was nonsense.  Getting a refund proved to be an ordeal, as they had to get the manager.  The manager came out, visibly annoyed.  And of course, I had to go to the other register, trying not to spill my warm drink on the floor.

The register didn't work, so they had to back to the original register.  After card swipes, keys, and other waiting, I asked for my card back.

Escaping the clutches of Burger King was worth $9.35.  

The manager got angry and snapped that I was getting my refund.  How long did he expect me to wait for a refund at an AIRPORT??

I raised my voice three times, 'just give me my card' and he finally did so.

All the while, there is a line of people, all with cups, because guess what?  Ass of a manager did not feel it important to tell the overpaying customers that there was no ice and that the drinks were Luke warm!

It has been some time since I have gone to Burger King anywhere, but I remember them having a decent grilled chicken sandwich- formerly the BK broiler.  This particular location also had some to go options- fruit, drinks, salads, & sandwiches.  I had a night flight and the salads appeared to be on the verge of going brown so I grabbed a cup of grapes.  I ordered the flame grilled chicken sandwich and requested it be dry and then specified- no mayo,  and a small fry.  I didn't notice until after being rung up the grapes were $4.29- typical airport I guess.  The food came up relatively fast although the staff was your typical group of slightly underwhelmed and miserable fast food workers.  We walked down to our gate as there was no seating open.  Upon opening my sandwich I found they had indeed left off the mayo, but also didn't put any lettuce or tomato on it.  The chicken immediately looked funny to me- certainly not a breast of chicken.  The dark color, texture, consistency and taste of the meat were all a bit odd and I can only describe it as a conglomerate of trash chicken parts that BK is now meshing together and making into a patty shape.  I actually pulled out a couple small clear harder type chunks from the ""chicken"".  The fries were also under seasoned which I'm guessing is more specific to this location.  I went in with low expectations which couldn't even be met.

The food took 22 mins to order (11:42 order time and received at 12:04). The order was nuggets, onion rings, and a plain cheeseburger. Not a fancy sandwich order, not a chicken sandwich, but basic common high frequency order things. We ordered those because we thought they would be quicker. We were wrong.

The cooks were dropping only one thing of fries and o-rings at a time so constantly running out and having to wait. 
The girl cooking burgers seemed on point, as the burgers were piling up on in the kitchen window.

Today was the cherry on top of the string of issues we've had with each visit. After the kids soccer pictures and practice, we decided we'd get dinner from there since it's a bit late to cook.

My burger was burnt (didn't know that possible with fast food).  My chicken sandwich was over cooked and nearly burnt.  Bread was stale, fries are ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS under seasoned, which I find hysterical because Burger King made a huge marketing push about their new fry seasoning, but nope you won't get any of it here EVER.   Fries are also almost always cold and/or undercooked.

The employees always seem to be upset and pointing out issues with the food to each other.  The grill man will be standing waiting on bread and complaining about something.

First, they need to fix their speaker system. Today, we spoke to two different people on the intercom. It's either they can't hear you or it's you can't hear them. 

Secondly, they never have powerade or lemonade available. We opted for waters instead, the lady at the window gave me someone else's large orange soda - I told her it wasn't mine. We had gotten waters. She went to hand me a water bottle and said oh nevermind you'll just get giant cups. Wasn't worth the struggle. 

My boys each got a number 4 meal with cheese and bacon only. They said it was good, but the fries were not salted well. I got the original chicken sandwich and it legit tasted like school cafeteria food.

We ordered unsweetened ice tea for both orders.  Got to the window and the girl said they just opened (it was 3pm on Sunday).  She asked us to move down and she would bring the order out to us.  If the person behind us had a short order or something that didn't take long to fix, they would have been out of luck since we sat in the drive and no one else could get around us.  Anyway, we finally got our food and I said thank you as she handed me the food and she just turned around and left.  We took the food home and found out that the unsweetened tea was soda instead.

The chicken tenders seemed cold as though they were old and they only gave me 3 instead of 4 like I had ordered and paid for.  I did a survey on how I felt about the service and food and told them what I thought.  At the end, they asked if a rep could contact me and I said yes.

After a long day of work, my stomach growling, I wanted something quick. I figured I'd swing by the local Burger King to satisfy my hunger. Perfect choice. 

I pulled in to the drive thru and eased up to the menu selection. I was promptly greeted and offered to try a new menu item. I politely declined, but it did sound tempting. 

I decided to spread the board. Not a meal, you say? Nope. I went for select items that I knew would satisfy my hunger. I ended up ordering a spicy chicken sandwich, rodeo burger, double bacon cheeseburger, onion rings (of course), and after confirmation of the promotional price - snagged a 10-piece chicken nugget for $1.49. I passed on the drink, as I had sweet tea at the house. 

I received my total, and was told to proceed to the next window. With a smile on my face, I thanked the person taking my order and scooted forward. I saddled up at the window with cash in hand. I was politely greeted by a nice lady with a smile. We exchanged pleasantries, made comments about the beautiful weather, and I paid for my meal. She informed me that my food would be ready shortly, and gently closed the window. 

As I was the only person in line, I didn't have much wait. Around 3 minutes later, a gentlemen comes to the window. He tells me that they had to put down a fresh batch of onion rings (YES!) and that it might be an extra minute. I told him it wasn't a problem, and kept jammin' to some tunes. 

Roughly a minute later, the same gentleman came back to the window. He asked me if I would like any sauces with my chicken nuggets. I told him I'd love some ranch and buffalo sauces - what a combo. Now, as he's gathering my order and placing it in the bag, he leaves the window open. The employees were all having fun and and joking around - seemed like a great night. 

My order is bagged and the gentleman, who I overheard called by the name of ""Cee"", politely hands me my awaiting dinner. He tells me to have a great night, and we parted ways. I drove home with the windows down, shades on, blasting music with nothing but the thought of Burger King on my mind. 

I arrive home and and immediately plop onto the couch, sweet tea and Burger King by my side. I open the bag, and to my delight and amazement, Cee managed to give me 2 each of BOTH sauces! Cee, you the real MVP! My order was spot on. Everything was fresh, and delicious. I ate everything in sight, and enjoyed every minute of it. I was completely, and utterly satisfied with my Burger King decision. I will most definitely be returning. 

For those of you that have had bad experiences, I strongly recommend that you give it another shot. Not only has this establishment really turned it around, I would consider it a hidden gem in Grandview. 

When you do decide to stop by, make sure you tell Cee that Rolland says thanks!

Room for improvement:

I've tried to order at the drive thru here several times within the hours they have listen online only to be told by someone that they are closed.

The couple of times I did make it when they were open, I've received burnt chicken nuggets that were hard as a rock, soggy fries that were completely flavorless, and chicken sandwiches that were chewy and stringy. Gross.

My most recent experience is what prompted me to leave this review. I ordered through the mobile app and showed up in the drive thru about 15 minutes later. The woman at the register handed me a bag that had been stapled shut and told me to keep it right side up because of the milkshake I had ordered. I know better than to leave this place without checking my order, so I rip open the bag. Of course, there is no milkshake. I tell the woman at the register and she claims she must have accidentally given it to the person in front of me. She said they just shut off the milkshake machine for the night and won't be able to get me one. This was blatantly a lie. Obviously they had not shut down the milkshake machine in the 20 seconds between me and the car that was in front of me and she had not moved at all to go check. She clearly knew there was no milkshake in the bag and was hoping that I wouldn't notice until I got home so she didn't have to deal with it. They probably have the milkshake machine in a perpetual state of being shut down. I am attempting to get a refund in the app right now...

The Whopper and Impossible Whopper are pretty good. However, for that price I might as well get a real burger at any of the bars in town. Yeah! Burger has a killer Impossible/Beyond burger.

She said okay as if she was annoyed and I ended up paying what I thought it should be.

Use your cheat meal like a superhero uses his tight underpants.  Slip out of that boring douche costume and wrap that spandex around your balls.  Unlike Superman, though,the point is to look fatter.  Superman looks like the underpants are painted on.  Your waist should look like a mushroom.

Look at the beauty that is the crisp, salty fried chicken sandwich before you eat it.  Appreciate those crisp edges sticking out from between the buns.  Then gently lift a bun and savor the look of the thick, creamy mayo, lettuce, and fresh tomato.  Throw that lettuce and tomato out.  It's too healthy.

Eat it lying down on the couch with a can of the shittiest piss-beer you can find and say, 

""Fuck you, muscles!""

It's rare instances like this in which I truly live in the moment.  Like everyone else, I sometimes worry about what's out of my control.  But when I hear the crunch of the breading, my five-year plan evaporates.  I'm fine with whatever life has in store for me after I swallow this bite.

If I end up looking like Ralphie May, (R.I.P.), I don't care.  In fact, I hope I do.  I'm going to order another ten of these everyday!  I'm going to get as big as possible so my asshole family goes broke cremating me.  I hope there's an afterlife so I can see how long it takes for them to start looking at their watches while the oven gets refueled for a fifth time.  I will crack up when someone finally says:

""Oh fuck this!  I'm already late for my Bumble date.  Do you guys have a dumpster out back?""

Then some litigious pansy neo-millennial will sue Burger King for premeditated shoving of sandwiches down my throat and loss of opportunity to get laid.

Count 1: I wanted coochie and you made my dad obese so make me rich.

Meanwhile, me, Ralphie, and the chiseled shark-attacker will be crying tears of laughter from the clouds, all of us realizing that what we looked like didn't matter after all.  I hope heaven has a BK.",0.00022659632034631276,Neutral

2365,Burger King,1.0,"Short version:

This store sucks.

Long version:

Disclosure:  I must admit, ever since they re-routed the turn lane off Andresen forcing customers up to 88th (and not right into Costco), I've always felt sorry for this BK and the Panda Express nearby.

Can you imagine spending all that money to be next to Costco and then the traffic gets re-routed so it doesn't go next to you?  It's terrible, it really is.

Anyway, I finally said, I'm not going go to buy that Chicken Bake at Costco and I'll give this BK my money because they got hosed. Besides, it's only a twice-a-year craving, but I do enjoy  the BK Stacker (kind of a Big Mac knock-off), so what the hell.

BIG MISTAKE.

I decide to go in.  Classic mistake #1.  I forgot that most fast food joints get graded on how fast they are at drive thru (they've got that big 'ol clock a tickin').  Not so for the dine-in, which pretty much means you're the red-headed step child of fast food diners.

Translation:  I waited, no joke, 15 minutes for a BK Stacker meal.  15 minutes.  Three people were ahead of me.

They finally get to my order, and he said, literally, ""oh, a BK Stacker"".  He takes the patty out of it's warming tray, slaps on some cheese, and the nukes the crap out of it!  In front of me!

Then, because I'm a glutton, I tossed in a chicken sandwich off of the $1 Menu (Spicy Chicken something something).  It was orange (oooh, fake spices) and paper thin.  Blaghh.  I can eat almost anything.  One bite was enough to ask WTF Burger King product planners were thinking.  Better just to not sell anything than that abomination.

2369,Burger King,3.0,"Burger King has really suffered in the fast food races in the last few years and it's not difficult to figure out why.  Their food prices have gotten so high for many of their sandwiches compared to their competition, the quality and size of their food offerings have shrunk and their special menu items have been, for the most part, failures.  They have also consistently been inconsistent and unpredictable in their breakfast menu choices and execution.  However I think one of their biggest problems are the lack of consistency from area to area.  Some restaurants are dirty, others are very clean, some charge you $5.79 for a single Whopper and others charge $2.99... It's just a big reason many people, including myself, don't go to Burger King anymore. 

This Burger King isn't bad, it's not great but it's not bad either.  Their prices are pretty well in line with what you'd expect, the help is not friendly but not rude either and the restaurant is usually pretty clean.  The only time I've really came here is when I have coupons which I sometimes find in the paper and that makes it worth it.  It's really just too expensive, in my opinion, to eat at a Burger King comparative to other local places you can eat so I really never go to any BK without coupons.  

One real complaint I have...the Whopper used to be delicious and a great burger, their flagship burger so to speak.  Now it's still the same sized bun, same lettuce, onion, tomato but the burger itself is thin as hell.  You really have to get a double Whopper to get about the same amount of meat you used to get with a regular Whopper just 5 or 6 years ago.  I think the Whopper Jr. is actually a better ratio of meat to bun than the actual Whopper.  And considering you're paying pretty good price for a Whopper they should not skimp on the meat like they do.

With that being said, the one sandwich I really liked when I got BK recently was their Italian Parmesan Chicken sandwich.  It was really tasty and comparable to what you'd get a decent Italian type restaurant.  I only bought it because I had a free coupon for one and was shocked it was so good.

I don't even think I've ever had anything that was messed up or missing. There was one time I ordered a chicken sandwich that was absolutely old and gross but I also know that if you're going to order fast food and you want it fresh then you need to make a substitution or change something on it so that it can be made fresh. Maybe a lot of people don't think of something like that but that's definitely the quickest way and easiest way to get fresh fast food. Every time I come here I've been in and out pretty fast. I do DoorDash in this area so sometimes I pick up orders here and I prefer to go inside to pick them up rather than going through the drive-through so you don't have to wait for other peoples orders to be made. They are pretty fast in the drive-through though so it's not like he would be waiting for very long. If you do go to use a coupon they do ask that you give them the coupon code when you order and before you get to the window so that they can input it correctly into the system instead of it being last minute.

I don't know why I have higher expectations for you, but I keep hoping you will change.  After all you are my favorite of the fast food chains even though you disappoint time and time again.

On my most recent visit I stopped in for a delicious chicken sandwich which I received timely and as expected.

I witnessed with my own eyes to my horror, the cook took the chicken out of the heater and put it back into the grease to re-cook! When I complained that you are not allowed to do this, the counter staff ""Mani"" just smiled as if it was perfectly acceptable. The other girl shrugged her shoulders as if she was powerless but agreed with me. Then to my shock, the cook took the two patties she just removed from the grease and had placed in my first sandwichs BACK IN THE HEATER! This was after she scraped off the cheese. I told the clerks about this and they just stood there. But they didn't do anything. If you want a potential to be posioned, then go there.",0.02071428571428573,Neutral

The service was terrible and I ordered food and then after they came and told us they didn't have some of the menu items. There was only one register open and as people started pouring in around noon no more registers were opened. You could see the people sitting around in the back not working and our orders took forever to come out. The drink station smelled like vomit and the sodas had no carbonation out of the machine. There was only about 10 drink selections but advertised with coke freestyle over 100 selections. There wasn't any condiments or napkins available in store and there was no ice in the machines.

(For the record, that's worse) and that it wasn't her problem, that the owner needed to deal with it. Then she began putting my order together. They had come up short one chicken sandwich. After yelling at her staff, it was discovered that my other sandwich had accidentally been sent out with someone else's order. This woman actually went outside and took the sandwich from whoever had it and brought it back inside and attempted to put it in my bag. When I stopped her and told her I wanted a new sandwich, she started cussing me out , indirectly, in Spanish unfortunately for her I am fluent. When I demanded my money back and told her to forget the order, she began telling anyone who would listen that I was crazy.

I was the only car in the drive thru and the restaurant was practically empty so it's not like the employees were busy. And they made me drive up to sit in the parking lot even though no cars were behind me. When I was a teenager I worked in fast food and I know that the time a car waits at the window is recorded so that's why this burger king always asks you to pull up front to sit in the parking lot forever so that they aren't running up the timer at the window. Every time I've gone the idiot employees seem to be high because they can't stop laughing and telling you to repeat your order 4 times.

Floors could be checked, there was some ice that had melted, near the railing, and a single mustard packet had opened & caused 'fusion' to other packets...store was empty - maybe a couple of applicants - but 8 people showed up in 20 minutes.  Must be busy randomly.

Liked the $1 chicken sandwich - another spot - won't name - raised their 'value meals' by another $0.60.  Not cool.

2418,Burger King,1.0,"This Burger King should be shut down. I have been stupidly coming here every few months or so for about 5 years. They change employees so often here, there is a brand new staff every few months. The constant change of staff puts false hope in my mind that the food will improve. It never does.

The food here is always dry. BK recipes call for a certain amount of condiments to be used in each sandwich. This particular location is notorious for using a lot less than the recipe calls for with mayo and sauces. This leaves any chicken sandwiches and burgers extra dry and nearly inedible.

When it comes to getting an order placed correctly, this location fails in this seemingly simple task. For example, if I order 6 things, there will always be either 1 missing from the receipt, the receipt will be correct but the wrong item in the bag, or something just plain missing from the bag.

I was giving my order and was repeatedly asked to speak louder, after giving part of my order I had mentioned that the order was wrong and that it was supposed to be 2 of one item and not of the other. Upon attempting to fix my order the employee told me to ""shut the hell up"" then after saying I wanted to speak to a manager I was told to ""get the hell out of here"".

I went into the store and demanded to talk to a supervisor that I assume was getting off as she said I could wait around for the other manager to take a report.  The person that my receipt (order 207) says took my order (that was the manager that I talked with) is 7017, Hunter S.

This is extremely unsatisfactory service; I've been frequenting your restaurants in the greater Portland area all of my life, and to be treated like this by someone who doesn't have any customer relations skills is completely ludicrous.

But recently they offered up a 2 for 1 on the 'Original' chicken sandwich.  I got home late from a business trip and nothing else was open so I came here.

This is NOT the original chicken sandwich.  In fact it wasn't even the chicken sandwich in the picture.  THe bread was changed to a ciabatta bread that was dry and stale.  The sandwich was smaller.  I was very disappointed.

I can't say I won't ever eat at a BK.  Sometimes you're places where there is nothing else...like say IN an airport.  But I find this just as disappointing as when McDonald changed their apple pie.",-0.20098039215686272,Negative
