1,Popeyes,1.0,"This is my first time at the Hartsfield Airport and I had no idea what the service at the Hartsfield Airport Popeyes would be like.  Sadly, it was far worse than any other Popeyes restaurant I've ever dealt with.

There were four employees there, working shoulder to shoulder, but despite their close proximity to each other, couldn't seem to communicate with each other.  The first employee took my order (Two large red beans & rice, one large Cajun fries and one grilled chicken sandwich), and wrote my name (Steve) on two paper bags.

Perhaps a minute or two later another employee starts calling out, ""STEVE!  IS THERE A STEVE HERE? STEVE?  STEVE?""

I was standing just a few inches away from her and said, ""I'm Steve.""

""YOU HAVE TWO RED BEANS AND RICE AND A LARGE CAJUN FRY?"" she asked me, yelling like a drill sergeant.

""Yes,"" I confirmed, ""Two large red beans and rice and a large Cajun fries"".

""ALSO A GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH?""

""Yes,"" I confirmed, ""One chicken sandwich.""

I ended up confirming my order with her and one other employee about three or four times.  Both with her and another employee who also shouted like a drill sergeant.

I thought this was ridiculous.  In most fast-food restaurants I only have to give my order information to one employee and I only have to do it once.  And traditionally none of the employees yell like drill sergeants.

The cashier also asked what was on my order, so I confirmed with her as well that I was supposed to get two large red beans and rice, one large Cajun fries and one grilled chicken sandwich.

My bill came to eighteen dollars and some change.  I paid the cashier and took my food to my boarding gate, approximately 300 yards away from the Popeyes restaurant and when I opened my bags I discovered that (despite the fact that I had told FOUR employees everything that was on my order), that my grilled chicken sandwich (which I had paid $5.17 for) was not in either bag.

2,Popeyes,4.0,"They weren't ready for the return of the chicken. They stopped taking orders when the restaurant appeared half full. The drive thru only had appeared to have about ten cars. They took on Chick-Fil-A on a day that they are closed. Definitely not the expedient service that I get at Chick-Fil-A, but to be fair, I get no service on Sunday at Chick-Fil-A!

As I write this review I see that cars are starting to wrap around the store. I don't know how it will go as the day goes on. But it's high noon and there's a showdown brewing. 

Chick-Fil-A has an awesome chicken sandwich. Always crispy and tasty. The sauces are also a huge plus at Chick-Fil-A. 

So I was in the drive thru while my wife was in line. She was able to order, so I hopped out of line. All of the cars in the drive thru behind me were gone before we got our food. It seems like it may be best to go in the drive thru. Even though the drive thru line is now running out of the lot. I'm guessing that they put a huge priority on the drive thru orders. 

People inside appear to be very angry. Two separate people complained about waiting nearly an hour for a sandwich. They said it on the way out somewhat grumbling. Perhaps attempting to warn others before they order. Unfortunately, my order is already in! And new people, with eyes full of hope are standing in line. Most of the people that were here with my half hour ago and still here. 

Now people are verbally warning others loudly about a 40 minute and counting wait. A gentlemen just walked out. Another cashier is calling number 13 about twelve times. Number 13 may have died of starvation. I'm scanning to ensure that no one appears to be hypoglycemic. 

My order is here! We are sitting at a very dirty table, I don't care, all I want is chicken. We ordered one regular and one spicy. 

The bread and chicken size get the nod. The texture of the breading is fantastic. The spicy flavor at Chick-Fil-A wrecks Popeye's. But the chicken sandwich here is great. 

The service was friendly despite a trying circumstance for the employees. Even so, the service and speed are far better at Chick-Fil-A. Well not counting the closest competition Chick-Fil-A, I don't even believe they are a real Chick-Fil-A.

11,Popeyes,1.0,"Pity the fool.

Woe to anyone who spends a dime at this Popeye's.  The many recent 1* reviews we found on Yelp are 100% true.  This location has the most incompetent and dishonest employees we've ever encountered in any restaurant in our life.  No exaggeration. 

No excuses on this visit:  we went at 5pm, before the dinner rush; we were the only car in the drive-through; and we saw at least 6 people wearing Popeye's uniforms standing around 'working' inside.

Our order was wrong:
1. Ordered spicy.  Repeated it twice to the young girl on the speaker taking our order, who repeated our order back to us correctly.  We received mild.  Mild was printed on our receipt. 
2. Our order was for 10 pieces of spicy mixed chicken.  Our box had 5 small drumsticks; 4 minuscule wings; and a teeny-tiny thigh. Our receipt showed we received 3 drumsticks; 3 wings; 2 thighs; and 2 breasts. Nope. Not even close.
3.  Paid for an additional spicy chicken sandwich.  We don't know if it was spicy, because our chicken sandwich was not included in our to-go bag.  Even though we paid for it and it was printed on our receipt. We can only conclude our chicken sandwich was stolen out of our order by an employee.
4. The tiny chicken pieces in our order were grossly over-cooked to the point of being inedible. Dry and shrunken and stringy and tasted burned.  We threw everything except the cole slaw and biscuits out.
5. The red beans and rice side we ordered was 75% dry over-cooked rice.  There were hardly enough red beans to cover the bottom of the small container.
6. The printed menu showed our 'family meal' order included 6 biscuits.  And '6 biscuits' was printed on our receipt.  The small box in our bag only had 5 biscuits.

We made the mistake of paying without looking at our receipt.  And compounded that mistake by then driving home without looking in our bag of food. 

The sheer incompetence, or stupidity, or most likely all of this plus the intentional manipulation and theft related to our order at this location boggles the mind.  

How many other customers aren't given the food they paid for?  Incompetent customer service notwithstanding, if you pay for something, isn't the store obligated to give you what you bought? 

In hindsight, we noticed the employees are mostly all grossly overweight.  Is this due to them stealing and then eating the customer's stolen food?  

Stealing food out of customer's orders means these dishonest employees would not get caught stealing from their employer.  So they keep their job while they fill up eating free stolen food.  

We suspect most customers will simply write-off the missing food as a random mistake.  Many customers won't even realize their order is wrong until they are long gone from the restaurant 20+ minutes down the interstate.  

Doing the math, if these dishonest employees steal  food from every customer like they stole ours, the amount of employee theft at this location is staggering.

Never eat here.  Don't go, no matter how much you crave a Popeye's spicy chicken sandwich.

14,Popeyes,1.0,"Yeah.... if I could give this place zero stars I would. Me and some friends went to Popeyes the other day and I was just outright appalled with my experience. Here were my problems.
First problem- the store opens at 10. Or it's supposed to anyway. The employees didn't open the doors until about 20 minutes later and one of them was on the phone walking around looking at us look at her. Yes, I know that's early to be eating chicken... (it's honestly never too early to eat chicken now that I think about it) but after working a graveyard shift and running errands, some chicken sounded great to all of us. Specifically that sandwich.
Second problem- when we wanted to order those chicken sandwiches, one of the employees told us that that it would take a while for the chicken to get ready. We were kind of frustrated and told him to give us a second so he walked away. As he walked away, the employees in the kitchen were still prepping and preparing. The ladies in the kitchen then got mad at us and started speaking Spanish about us. Little did they know, one of our friends is bilingual and heard them say, ""how do you expect us to have everything ready when we just opened five minutes ago?"" And my response to my friend was that the store was supposed to be opened 30 minutes ago. 
We eventually got our chicken sandwiches but when we wanted sauces they said it was one sauce per combo!!! What the heck???? 
I thought fast food restaurants were supposed to be ready and prepped when the store opened?

Last week I went through the drive through to try this chicken sandwich.  Bun was smooched and the chicken tender leaning toward soggy.  Not really that impressive.  That just primed me to get some good chicken on a Saturday night.  14-piece meal with half and half, 7 biscuits, mashed potatoes/gravy with cole slaw.  I really like the flaky breading on the chicken and the pepper tones to the gravy.  Biscuits are the same old dense pucks.

By going in, I saw why the chicken sandwiches sucked, why the biscuits are always cold, and why the drive through is so slow.  About 40-50 sandwiches were pre-made and sitting in two piles under the warmer.  How does FIFO work with that process?  And in the 25 unbelievable minutes it took me to order and get my food, only about 5 were sold.  Gross.

-I was third person in line.  No one seemed to be tending the counter.  No cohesive expediter function.  After about 5 minutes, the woman and her child waiting at the register left.  Now second in line!
-They didn't have record of my online order, and only 5 orders were on the screen.  So I reordered about 10-12 minutes after entering the store.
-They couldn't provide a receipt as proof of purchase.  Out of paper.
-Out of fries too.

With the explosive marketing of their new chicken sandwich I would have liked to see Popeye's use the opportunity to build a stronger customer base.

I tried both the classic and the spicy sandwich and preferred the spicy. The classic was bland and dry while the spicy has a bold tasting sauce and more flavor. For me the sandwich is made in a Paul Deen type style....Extra fat, calories and a big portion of crispy batter. The batter makes the sandwich appear huge and creates a feeling of value.

The verdict is: it's pretty damn good. The chicken pieces are tender and well covered in crunchy batter. The portion of chicken is pretty big (1 inch depth) and come lathered in mayo (classic) or spicy mayo (spicy). The pickles add a salty, sour taste to counter the creamy sauce. There's no cheese, which was disappointing. But for $4? It's not worth it.

Once in your hands, it is worth the wait.  The chicken filet is crunchy on the outside and moist and tender in the center.  It is seasoned with mayo and dill pickles.  The bun stands up to the breast filet and seasoning to make quite a neat and tasty package.  I very much enjoyed my sandwich.

In the back, the operation did not look clean at all either. If they had to complete an inspection, they definelty would've failed. When I recieved my food it was also slightly cold. 

I understand that the chicken sandwich meals have been a huge curve ball for many of these establishments, but I still expect a level of cleanliness and good service when I'm paying for it. 

Overall, I've had both the spicy and original chicken sandwhichs, and they're both just ok. The only difference between the two is that one has some type of spicy sauce that comes on the sandwich, while the original has no kind of extra sauce on it. 

On the plus side, the prices of the meals are pretty reasonable, and they will fill you up.

The fries and green beans were also delicious. And the bourbon fudge pie was amazing, and pricey for the size.

It makes sense that the chicken would be fried prior to speed up the process but to pre-assemble the sandwiches is gross. Even if I wanted a sandwich with pickles I certainly wouldn't want it knowing that my sandwich has been sitting there for who knows how long before I even placed my order.

137,Popeyes,2.0,"Ugggggggh! It PAINS me to give this experience 2 stars. However, it's what I can be at peace with giving.
Our experience initially started off with all 5 stars. We arrived here at 10:30 this morning. We were the second car in line in the drive-thru. The place opened at 11:00- but we had just found out this morning prior to arrival, the chicken sandwiches were back! Since we had missed our chance the first go round for these ""famous"" delights, we knew we had to go today on National Sandwich Day! 
So my husband and I were the 2nd car, our daughter and her boyfriend the 3rd car. By 11:00 opening time, the line was literally wrapped around the building and spilling onto the Main Street that leads to this location's parking lot. During our wait (completely elective, mind you), a woman (presumably the manager) was going car to car informing everyone that they don't open until 11:00. Not sure why she felt the need to tell us that, but ok. So we get to the speaker to place our order and that's when we went from 5 stars down to 2-
We ordered 6 regular chicken sandwiches. Specifically, 3 without mayo, 1 completely plain and 2 without pickle. Apparently, this was just information overload for the woman on the other side of the speaker. She continued to repeat the order for the sandwiches incorrectly, and when we would attempt to correct her, this caused her to get a major attitude. This was literally the biggest communication breakdown over something so simple. And we were CAR #2 for the start of the day, no less. We weren't ONLY ordering the 6 sandwiches, but apparently this woman (our receipt says ""Veronica"", but who knows if that's who this actually was, as at one point during our ordering, it was noticeably a new voice coming through the speaker)- we eventually ordered a large Cajun rice and 2 large drinks.

173,Popeyes,1.0,"Went Sunday 12/1/19 in the afternoon to try the infamous chicken sandwich to see what all the hype was about and how it stacked up against Chic Fil A. Waited a total of a half an hour, maybe even more, in the DRIVE THRU! I spent 10+ minutes sitting at the intercom just waiting for someone to take my order. I pull up to the window, employees sitting there ordering  clothes or something off their phones, unfriendly employees, etc. And to top it off the sandwiches were lukewarm to say the least, had to heat them up the moment I got home. Not a frequent customer at fried chicken restaurants, but I'll make sure next time I'll visit KFC in Brockton instead.

188,Popeyes,2.0,"The key to good food no matter where it's from is freshness, and sadly, the day I went that happened to be Christmas day left me feeling dissatisfied. 

I had the best chicken sandwich a few days prior from the same chain and was craving it all week long, so when I was driving up the Turnpike and saw this location was open, I was super pumped!

Chicken sandwich I ordered came in spicy, and it was due to their intercom not working well; I corrected the lady but she must not have heard me. 

What made my chicken sandwich undesirable was that it was not as juicy as I've had before; they must have pre-made 10 or more sandwiches and just left them there. This causes the crunchiness of the batter to go soggy, not to mention the bun and chicken loosing its' freshness. 

Sure I know it's fast-food but surely they are capable of doing so much better like not making so many sandwiches in advanced. 

I had to return one of the sandwiches since it was spicy and went inside; that's when I saw how many were just sitting there with no one in line at that moment ready to buy any. Yes it's a matter of efficiency but there's a slippery slope to quality; I would have gladly waited 5 mins for a freshly done sandwich.

The drive thru was relatively fast and my sandwiches were made fast. When I got home, only four of those were original and one was spicy. Not what I asked for.

The other time my husband went because I wanted a chicken sandwich and Chick-Fil-A wasn't as close (not that they compare). He ordered two original sandwiches. When he brought them home and I bit into one of the sandwiches, it was spicy. Again, not what I asked for. I thought I could eat it but I wasn't in the mood for spicy (which is why I ordered the original), so I ended up switching with my husband half way.

I will say each time I went I had to wait 15-20 minutes In the drive thru because they are incredibly slowww. 

The first time I went I ordered there signature chicken box with two sides of mashed potatoes and coleslaw. The chicken was way to salty and the food was cold! It tasted old, I also had a dr.pepper drink that tasted watered down, I thought maybe it was because I went late at night that was probably the reason... Nope

My second experience was when I ordered the spicy chicken sandwiches one for me and one for my brother with cajun fries and two dr.pepper drinks, I also ordered the strawberry pies and apple pies. The chicken sandwich was wayyy to spicy, it tasted rubbery and it was cold, the Cajun fries were cold, soggy, and stale, and the drinks also tasted water downed it didn't taste like soda. The  pies were  hard as rock,cold and coated in way to much cinnamon and sugar they were not pleasant at all. Way to overpriced when I can get a better meal at chic fil a. 

My third experience was with the chicken tenders box that comes with 2 sides and no drink even tho they advertise it with a drink. I thought whatever since there soda tasted off anyways.. well the chicken tenders were cold and stale, noodles fresh at all, the Mac & cheese I got was cold, soggy and very watery... and the coleslaw I got was way to watery..

210,Popeyes,3.0,"(11/27/2019)  Finally got the infamous Popeye's Spicy Chicken Sandwich, and it was damn good. The bun is like butterbread, soft and tender.  I've found the other fast food buns generally bland and pasty, and usually somewhat stale.  Maybe the lightning fast turnover and low volumes (this was my 3rd time trying to get this sandwich and they've run out every time).

After many failed attempts Months ago (they were always out), I FINALLY tried the chicken sandwich... Let me just say... It MAY look pretty but those of you saying it's better than Chick Fil A are OUT OF YOUR MIND.

At this point everyone is raving over this chicken sandwich. My co-worker and I arrived at this location at 9:55 before they opened. We planned on ordering lunch for the staff. The drive thru line was already starting to come out of the parking lot. We parked are vehicle and stood in line outside the store. There were about 12 people in line to go into the store. At 10:02 we all take notice that a gentlemen  who we assumed to be the manager looked extremely irritated. He kept looking at us and shaking his head, and then walking around the store fixing chairs as opposed to opening the door. He finally unlocked the door at 10:05 when the crowd started to get really annoyed. When we all walked in, he did not greet us he left to go behind the store. Their was one cashier, she was still counting change so she could not ring anyone up yet. The first gentleman was finally able to place his order in around 10:12am. The line started to take notice that there wasn't any chicken cooked at all yet. I think we all
Assumed that they would be prepared for the crowd and have some cooked already.  Instead we noticed he put out the regular chicken out first. When literally everyone in line was there for sandwiches. By the  managers actions you could tell he hoped that the lot of us would leave if the food wasn't available. If that was his motive it worked. We decided to leave, and I did ask for his name so i could file a complaint. A few other people asked Me what his name was as well. I gave it to them, when we walked out the line was far worse and already piling into the intersection of the street. Of course problem Naturally asked me why i wasn't walking out with food. I made sure to let them know that the manager Jarvis was ill prepared the food would take very long as none of it is prepared at the moment and also the manager wasn't customer friendly at the moment.

She asked us if we wanted our food for there or to go and we said to go, and she got the bags and yanked them open. Then she went to the back for about 5 minutes as there is a large line accumulating behind us.. as we were waiting another cashier by the name of ""keke"" or something along the lines of that was giving the other customers the biggest attitude and then she left and threw a cup on the floor. Our cashier returns, and my mother asks if she wants us to pay because she hadn't told us a total or told us to pay yet, so she said ""yeah I want you to pay"" with the biggest attitude. Never in my life have I experienced behavior so rude, disgusting, and disrespectful. We purchased a biscuit and it was never received. She also gave me no toppings at all on my chicken sandwich because I asked for sauce on the side, which was also not received.. After we finally paid it had been a total of around 15 minutes because of the wait time just to be able to PAY. We were waiting for our food and we got drinks, but there was no ice, we asked our cashier to please get us some ice and she gave us the biggest attitude and eye roll.

(Note to people not familiar with the area: this at least a 3 mile distance).

(It should be noted that only drive thru and counter service are open; no inside seating is allowed at this time.  Masks are required due to local ordinance).

Manager and sandwich line cook were not wearing masks properly over their noses.  He also did not say anything to family that came in to order without wearing any masks, even though signs in window and right next to cashier state masks must be worn.

Manager got into a full on argument with an Uber driver over food and Uber contract regulations - in the middle taking the maskless family's order. Apparently this location will not make up an uber order until the driver is there for the pickup, so the ""food is hot"" when picked up. 

Long drive through line wrapping around building is why I went in to order. Only 2 groups in front of me - shouldn't take long to order, right? WRONG!!
Drive thru line moved slowly (from reports from my group in car outside), but at least it moved - although looking back, not sure that these people ever got their food as there were a lot of cars parked out front waiting.

Manager inside store would only take one order and wait until jt was completely filled before moving on to next order - even if food had to be cooked for that order. So the huge Uber order was now in front of the maskless family's dinner orders.  All we wanted were 2 chicken sandwiches that we've heard so much about. I could see the chicken filets in the sandwich area as the cook just put a fresh bin up . . . But can't even order until all of the big family meals of chicken and shrimp and wings are cooked for the orders ahead of me.

The uber guy gets his many bags of food. The maskless family finally gets their dinners.  The guys in front of me order and get their bags of food.

I think Yay!! I'm next! I can finally order those 2 chicken sandwiches!!  Why wouldn't I think I'm next to order? I'm next in line right?  

WRONG! 

I get to cashier and he asks if I'm with Uber. I say no. He points to guy two back behind me (who walked in 5 minutes earlier) and says he's with Uber and his order needs to be completed first, and to wait.

We ended up waiting for about 30 minutes and nothing. I had to send someone in and see what was going on and they still had to wait about 10-15. The employees started talking about him in the back right in front of him where he was able to hear them. When he got back to the car, all they gave him was the three chicken sandwiches and not the family meal. We then had to send my mom in to get the rest of the order where the employee gave her a nasty attitude saying she ""remembers this order"" and knows ""they got their food already"" when we clearly didn't. The lady then proceeded to ask where the chicken sandwiches were (as they were in the car) and wanted proof that all we got was the chicken sandwiches.

268,Popeyes,4.0,"Hey guys, I don't typically write reviews about fast food chain restaurants because I rarely eat at them. I felt compelled to write a review for Popeyes due to the craze surrounding the new chicken sandwich that recently debuted and have made rounds on social media like a wild fire. 

I have lined up for half an hour for  ramen, maybe even more, but I have never lined up for a chicken sandwich. Would you wait half an hour for a chicken sandwich? What's the big deal with Popeyes new chicken sandwich and the social media craze with some places being sold old until September, stressed stressed employees, people selling the sandwich for a ridiculous amount of money on eBay, some guy trying to sue the chain because he couldn't get a hold of a sandwich he allegedly purchased from an employee and not only the sandwich was not delivered but he also sustained damages to his car and is being made fun of by his friends. The hype is way way too much! How will the sandwich ever live up to one's expectations?  It can't possibly right? Right? 

Let me just say, best chicken sandwich I have had. I tried the spicy and non spicy and I liked them both, maybe the non spicy a little more. I have had chicken sandwiches where the meat is dry, the meat to bread ratio is off, ones where the buns, and I hate buns, was dry and tasted like it was made in a paper mill, ones where the fry is oily, and ones with weird sauces, not enough pickles, you name it, all the possible things that can go wrong with a chicken sandwich. 

My first thought biting into the brioche bun, again, I hate bun, is that it is actually very tasty. So I am telling myself at this point, yes! Then came the crispy outer layer of the chicken, then the real meat juicy chicken fillet, and plenty of sour pickles. I am digging it! So yes guys, the Popeyes chicken sandwich is a must try. If you hate it for any reason other than simply hating it then you and I and wired differently. 

This isn't just a review of the chicken sandwich. I eat Popeyes about once a year. No particular reason other than the potential weight gain if I have it more often. And the Everett location is the closest to where I live. It's on route 16, plenty of parking, line is not too too bad. For fast food, they have really good fried chicken. Fries are okay, my one true love will always be Burger King fries and then when I am wearing my fancy pants, the truffles fries from Crave- Mad for Chicken in Chinatown Boston. I also don't get that sick feeling after eating the fried chicken that I do after eating at KFC. I also like Popeyes string beans and definitely the pickled jalapeño. They also have Dr. Pepper, my favorite soda. And the apple pie was small but it's all you really need. It reminded me of the apple pie I had at a Macdonald's in London. It's so unfair. You'd think Americans would eat that up more so than the English no? So why is their apple pie better than the ones sold at McDonalds here? But I digress. If I could, I would eat at Popeyes at least once a month but you see, I have self control. And I know the addiction can be real. Once you start you can't stop. Where's my Pringles at? So I will stop here, before I start to plan my next trip to Popeyes.

I hate pickles and the fact that there was already pickles in there and we can't customize it was a big no for me. Even taking the pickles out, I still tasted the pickles.

284,Popeyes,1.0,"While I realize there's a pandemic going on, the staff of this location does not care about service or quality whatsoever. I guess with limited options, why care?

At 9PM on April 15th, everything in Merritt Island looked closed. My pregnant wife was in labor, but we were sent home from the hospital due to her not being ready. Both of us were exhausted and very hungry, but she was also in pain from contractions. We needed something quick to take home.

We spotted Popeyes was open and people were in line. We were excited to finally get a chance to try the chicken sandwich we had heard so much about. In hindsight, this was a critical mistake, but we needed food and didn't think we'd find anywhere else open due to unusual circumstances.

The line was moving sloooowly. We weren't sure what the delay was because we could see the staff behind the counter. There looked to be about 6 people working. Once we got to the speaker to order, I had to repeat what we wanted several times till it was repeated back to me. A chicken sandwich meal with an unsweet tea and an extra solo chicken sandwich. Not complicated. 

While making our way around the building, a staff member was spraying out some sort of grease catcher right next to our car while balancing this large, stainless steel tub on top of a rolling trash can right outside the back door. Thanks for the bonus making us extra nervous during a night of grief.

After some time, we finally made it to the window. The young woman working repeated some wrong order to us. I had to re-order our food for about the 4th or 5th time now. While she rang us up and went to get the food, we could clearly see why there was a delay. The whole staff was goofing off with the manager and not caring about the slow moving line wrapped around the building. The woman hands us our bag of food and proceeds to stare at us blankly. I had to ask for our unsweet tea. She gets wide eyed saying, ""OH!"" and goes to get it. Comes back and asks, ""Unsweet??"". Good lord, Popeyes. Finally we get our drink and get out of there.

It took us ~35 minutes from start to finish. The tea was sweet, old and had no ice. The sandwiches were sweaty and soggy from self steaming in the baggies they come in. They resembled mush. There was no point in trying to go back after all this and wait in line again (plus the doors were locked to the dining room). We just wanted to turn in for the night considering all the aforementioned circumstances.

Try the apple pie as well but I rather prefer the Raspberry Cheesecake Pie myself - I usually get about 7 of them ... you know ... to pass around to friends.

Please don't tell anyone!

Listen - this chicken sandwich is the real deal hands down - shut yo mouth!!!

Popeyes is second to none & I've read about Chic-Fil-A (will try it once the border opens up again) but numbers don't lie!

Popeyes since August 2019 has sold over 200 million chicken sandwiches!!!!!

Yes go ahead & say it - WHOA!!!

Popeyes is king & slaying all competitors who are currently locked up in secret laboratories trying to concoct a better sandwich!!!

McDonald's will launch their new chicken sandwich in the new year & apparently its being tested out right now in the Deep South!

If you think there's a better sandwich out there - let me know about it!!!

For more salivating detail please see my other Popeyes review!

Ask for & try their unique dipping Signature Sauces (there's several options so check the menu list) if required for your fries or even the sandwich.

Popeyes Richmond has just opened up today - with more stores on the way across Metro Vancouver!!!

This location is close to Ikea & Home Depot across the road.

Look for Jordans Home furniture store & right next to it is Popeyes.

Have a chicken sandwich first then you can go off & do all your furniture & home decor shopping.

290,Popeyes,3.0,"Another CHICKEN place in Richmond and there is a lot of hype about this one so I was excited to get a taste of their bonafide chickennn~~ I LOVE FRIED CHICKEN so got almost EVERYTHING on the menu that was available. 

First the process!
The wait wasn't too bad for 5 days since opening day, only around 30 mins and 15 mins for the food. The ordering was chaotic with so much going on but the staff were quite patient. Though they were very inconsistent, as they ran out of biscuits and offered a free side instead for my boyfriend's order yet when it was my turn, they didn't offer me the same offer and I have pay additional for my side even though I had a platter. But since it's the opening week, it's understandable since I came here for the FOOD! 

The Food! 
I got the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, Butterfly Shrimp, Popcorn Shrimp, Cajun Fries, Mashed Potatoes with Cajun Gravy, Onion Ring and Mac & Cheese.
Let's start with the GOOD. 

The Chicken Sandwich is PRETTY GOOD. Soft and Juicy, the combination of sauces and condiments were perfect. Would come just for Sandwich. The sides like the Cajun Fries and Mac & Cheese were BIG! Fries spiced well and the Mac & Cheese was creamy. The Mashed Potatoes was decent, overall liked their sides a lot so far. 

Now for the things that need improvement...
Now, I actually have tried Popeyes in Ontario before so I wasn't that hyped but with Fried Chicken as the main feature...First, the chicken was DRY. 4/6 Pieces were so dry. Not a lot of spice on the Chicken. The mild chicken was drier than the spicy one, I believe. Popcorn Shrimp was so small that I can barely taste them. The Butterfly Shrimp were much better but even then, with it being almost $8, the portion was small. The Onion Rings were the worst I had. I don't think anyone can ruin onion rings but they sure showed me. The onion part was thick and crunchy (a semi-raw onion?). We all tried one and had to throw the rest away which was sad cause I paid extra for it. 

I know a lot of people have said the food gets soggy fast but we ate it across the street (like a 1 min drive) and our fries were getting soggy already. I feel like it due to the air trapped inside the bag? I would have to try Popeyes once dine in is available again since I feel like it's a place for dine-in more.

Ever wondered what's in the Popeye's tent? Nothing. Just the aroma of freshly fried chicken to lure you in and convinces you not to leave the line. Visualize a mime doing its rope act.

The outside line actually wasn't that bad. It took 13 minutes and we're through the door. The line might look long because of the 2m social distancing in effect.

We got in, ordered our food and waited. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. They have a lot of staff prepping and making food so it's more efficient than, let's say, another chain's Cyber Monday deal where peeps waited 2+ hours in line to get their order.

There were quite a bit of people inside waiting for their order to get called up. Orders that are just regular combos gets sent out pretty quick. But if the order includes family meals of fried chicken then expect to wait a little longer. 

It took about 10 minutes to get what we ordered which includes 4 chicken sandwiches and a 16 pc meal. We opted for no sides because they ran out of biscuits and that's the one we would like to try. So no biscuits review this time.

The chicken sandwiches are really good. Juicy, tender fried chicken with mayo and pickles--Mmm! Hype confirmed. Options, mild or spicy. Mild, is just regular, no heat. We got 2 plain chicken sandwiches, no pickles or mayo for the kiddies.

294,Popeyes,5.0,"POPEYES KITCHEN 
When you can see Popeyes is everywhere on social media, you know the hype is no joke. I am so excited that Popeyes finally launched their first location in Richmond, that means I'm 15 mins away from the true deliciousness without driving all the way to surrey or poco!

At @popeyesca We ordered:
5pcs spicy chicken w/ mashed potatoes 
5pcs regular chicken w/ Mac & Cheese 
1 spicy chicken sandwich &
1 regular chicken sandwich 

I see the battle here: 
Church's chicken or Popeyes? For me so far, I'll def take Popeyes over church's.
Popeyes chicken remind me of the chicken that I had in Asian KFC: they are tender, well-seasoned, crispy and not overly oily. You just can't help to eat more and more until you devour all of them. 

My favourite is definitely the spicy chicken sandwich. A great chunk of fried chicken is stuffed in the middle, with their special dressing and pickles. The buns are soooooo soft that you'll def fall in love with it right away. I didn't feel too heavy after a few bites on the sandwich, which I like it a lot.

My least favourite item among my order would be the mashed potatoes. I mean don't hope up a lot on a fried chicken specialist to make everything perfectly; as long as they do their job right, that's the whole point. I can't even complain :)

Have you tried Popeyes before? FYI they will still open on Christmas Eve and even Christmas. Yea, it might not be the food that you need for Christmas, but def will be the food that you crave! Life is short, just love yourself some fried chicken! Merry Christmas guys!!

However, everything else is fan-freaking-tastic. Service is quick and friendly and the food is spiced and marinated to perfection. They even have blackened chicken tenders for people looking for a low carb, low fat option, and there are more than just fries to the sides.

310,Popeyes,3.0,"Popeyes' chicken sandwich came out on August 12, 2019 and there was a lot of hype surrounding it at the time. I saw, read, and heard about the long lines and long waits to get the sandwich. I let several months pass before deciding to give the sandwich a try. It happened at this location, Popeyes store #192.

This Popeyes is located just off I-85 exit 91 (Clairmont Road) at the corner of Clairmont and Briarcliff. It's been around for as long as I can remember. It's a somewhat small restaurant with limited, but adequate, parking. We ordered using the drive-thru. There were only two cars ahead of us when we pulled into the drive-thru lane.

We ordered two chicken sandwich combos so we could try both flavors (there are only two). We ordered the #8 Classic Chicken Sandwich combo and the #9 Spicy Chicken Sandwich combo. Both combos were $6.49 each and each included a side and a drink. A chicken sandwich alone was $3.99.

Like Chick-fil-A, Popeyes' chicken sandwiches were served inside foiled-lined paper sleeves. In short, the sandwiches were good. I'd order them again. However, I think Chick-fil-A's sandwiches are better. The difference between Popeyes' classic chicken sandwich and its spicy chicken sandwich is the sauce. The classic comes with mayo and the spicy comes with spicy mayo. Each sandwich came with two pickle slices. The mayo and pickles were placed atop the bottom bun, beneath the chicken fillet. In contrast, Chick-fil-A sandwiches do not come with any sauce. Chick-fil-A sandwiches also come with pickles placed atop the bottom bun.

Based on this one experience, I think Chick-fil-A chicken sandwiches (which I've had countless times over the years) are superior in terms of taste and texture. They've really got it down. Also, Chick-fil-A's bread holds up better. The bread we got on these two sandwiches was relatively dry and broke apart easier when compared to Chick-fil-A bread.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed these Popeyes sandwiches. They had decent flavor and the pieces of chicken, to me, were meatier than the pieces of chicken in Chick-fil-A's sandwiches. There was more lean meat in them. Popeyes' spicy chicken sandwich is also spicier than Chick-fil-A's spicy chicken sandwich. Note Chick-fil-A's spice is applied directly around the chicken fillet whereas Popeye's spice is in the sauce. Popeyes wins for having the crunchier batter. And I think they have bigger, thicker pickle slices too.

TL;DR version: If you haven't tried Popeyes' chicken sandwich yet, I think they're tasty and worth trying.

As for the sides, we got coleslaw and onion rings. There was a $0.20 upcharge on the rings and the receipt specifically specified there would be only six rings. The slaw and rings were fine. I almost always order slaw when eating Popeyes. It helps balance out the fried chicken for me. The rings were average at best (nothing to write home about). As a bonus, we got free Cajun fries. I think they may have put the fries in our bag by mistake. Whatever the case, we ate 'em all. Popeyes fries are alright. I do like the coleslaw though.

We got a Coke and Diet Coke with our combos. They tasted a little flat and watered down. Below average and slightly disappointing. The cups and lids were pretty flimsy too. The lids easily came off which isn't good when you're driving.

Service was A-OK.

In the end, when it comes to chicken sandwiches and the overall dining experience (drive-thru included), Chick-fil-A wins, in my opinion. Not only are Chick-fil-A's sandwiches better overall, but so is their service (more polite and better-trained employees). And their stores, inside and out, are nicer and better-maintained.",  Popeyes chicken sandwich come August lot hype surround time saw read hear long line long wait get sandwich let several month pass decide give sandwich try happen location Popeyes store Popeyes locate exit Clairmont Road corner Clairmont Briarcliff around long remember somewhat small restaurant limited adequate parking order use drive thru two car ahead us pull drive thru lane order two chicken sandwich combo could try flavor two order Classic Chicken Sandwich combo Spicy Chicken Sandwich combo combo include side drink chicken sandwich alone Like Chick fil Popeyes chicken sandwich serve inside foil lined paper sleeve short sandwich good order However think Chick fil sandwich well difference Popeyes classic chicken sandwich spicy chicken sandwich sauce classic come mayo spicy come spicy mayo sandwich come two pickle slice mayo pickle place atop bottom bun beneath chicken fillet contrast Chick fil sandwich come sauce Chick fil sandwich also come pickle place atop bottom bun Based one experience think Chick fil chicken sandwich countless time year superior term taste texture really get Also Chick fil bread hold well bread get two sandwich relatively dry break apart easy compare Chick fil bread get wrong still enjoy Popeyes sandwich decent flavor piece chicken meaty piece chicken Chick fil sandwich lean meat Popeyes spicy chicken sandwich also spicy Chick fil spicy chicken sandwich Note Chick fil spice apply directly around chicken fillet whereas Popeye spice sauce Popeyes win crunchier batter think big thicker pickle slice TL DR version tried Popeyes chicken sandwich yet think tasty worth try side get coleslaw onion ring upcharge ring receipt specifically specify would six ring slaw ring fine almost always order slaw eat Popeyes help balance fried chicken ring average best nothing write home bonus get free Cajun fry think may put fry bag mistake Whatever case eat em Popeyes fry alright like coleslaw though get Coke Diet Coke combo taste little flat water average slightly disappoint cup lid pretty flimsy lid easily come good drive Service OK end come chicken sandwich overall dining experience drive thru include Chick fil win opinion Chick fil sandwich well overall service polite well train employee store inside nice well maintain,-0.047998768472906364,Negative
311,Popeyes,1.0,"Marques Terry, who identified himself as the district manager, was extremely loud, rude and disrespectful to me on August 5, 2020, around 7:30pm EST.

I'd placed an online order through the Popeyes app as part of the T-Mobile Tuesday promotion, and planned to supplement the order with additional items at the window.

When I got to window, I told the cashier (a woman, not Mr. Terry) that I'd placed an online order and gave her my name. She then proceeded to search for my order, verbally stating that she could not find the name in the system (though the name she kept repeating was not my name).

 Mr. Terry then approached the window and told me ""it's a hit or miss, and we haven't seen an order for your name"". I informed him that the name she kept repeating was in fact not my name. He then said (without searching), ""well I know your name hasn't come through for an order. It's a hot or miss.""  I try to inquire about why the order hadn't gone through on his end and tried to show him the confirmation on the Popeyes app and he told me to ""get out his line"" and threatened to call the police when I asked additional questions about the glitch. This all occurred in perhaps 2 minutes or less (after being in line for maybe 10 minutes). 

I still wanted to place an order (having drove all the way there), but he kept telling me to get out his line (despite my card in hand). He not once asked me if I still wanted to place an order and ignored my saying I wanted to do so at least 2-3 times.

312,Popeyes,2.0,"This review is for the location at the corner of Briarcliff and Clairmont Road.

We have patronized this location very few times during the 12 years that we have lived in our subdivision nearby. The reason is the consistently disappointing experience.  Today's visit was no different.

The interior dining area was open for patrons to enter and order takeout however upon driving into the small parking area there were employees smoking right at the door. Not a great impression and I am sensitive to the smoke so I chose to enter the drive through.

Ultimately it was a 31 minute ordeal from point of entry until receiving my food. Once you enter the drive through you are trapped since there isn't an adjacent lane to depart. The lane and parking area are small and tight.

Once I arrived at the speaker a garbled voice asked for my order. Due to the poor audio quality I specifically spoke loud and slow to make sure that my order was understood. I wanted the #9 Spicy chicken combo with Diet Coke and the #11 shrimp combo with Diet Coke.

Midway in a sentence the voice interrupts me and tells me to hold on. The speaker was still active so I could hear her arguing with someone else that was already at the window for food.  I had to repeat my order three times in order to make sure that she understood my order. Then she informed me that they were out of Diet Coke- ironic since there were promotional signs in the windows and landscaping promoting Diet Coke- running out of a popular drink at 6pm on a Wednesday is inexcusable.

Upon arriving at the window a young server without a mask asked me what I had ordered- not exactly confidence inspiring and I made a mental note to pull into a space and check the order before leaving.

My food was handed to me on a tray with minimal conversation.  I asked for the dipping sauce and ketchup that I had already clearly requested three times when I was ordering at the speaker since both were missing from my order.  The fact that I had to ask four times for condiments made it clear that this crew of employees lack attention and organization.

At no point in any verbal communication with the employees did anyone ever say ""thank you "" or ""please "" or any other pleasantries- the complete opposite of the service experience at competitors nearby such as Chick  fil A or Newks.

I pulled into a parking space and checked my order and everything was correct.

I live five minutes up the road so the food was still hot and fresh when Mark and I removed everything from the bag.

Mark said his spicy chicken sandwich and fries were good. My shrimp basket with fries and biscuit and the buffalo dipping sauce was good as well.

Obviously we are in a pandemic and it's common knowledge that patrons will prefer drive through service so a 31 minute ordeal is unacceptable and they need to plan better.  Had there been space to depart the lane I would have abandoned the process after the 15 minute mark.

The employees need customer service training and training on organizational efficiency.

So I went to popeyes to eat and one thing about me is that I HATE drive thru's. It's just not my thing so I always try to walk in. I get that you wanna close early, I get that you gotta clean up, etc., all of that. BUT if the door is open, let the person in and just lock it after u realized u made a mistake.

By now I was still okay but here's why I hate this particular one: YOU COULDNT ESCAPE. About 5 minutes in, I realized I made a grave mistake by not leaving. I was literally STUCK in the drive thru for a hour. I couldn't back up, I couldn't pull out to the side, NATHAN, just stuck.

He tried to tell them they not spicy, but the didn't even look at him at first. When they finally acknowledged it, they tried to give us a bullshit excuse about there's no difference. If it's one thing you not gonna do is take me and my friends for idiots. Take us on a date, take us on a ride, cool, BUT don't not take us for idiots.

So after a hour of being captive, at least have the order correct, that's it. That's the least you can do. Literally no part was right and y'all were strong and wrong about it.

How'd it turn out?

Service - surprisingly slow given the amount of activity behind the counter and the long line. 

Food - they were out of the spicy chicken sandwich. I guess the classic will do. They were also out of mashed potatoes (like whaaat?). 

So how was the sandwich? Interesting. There were all pre-made and tossed in bags wrapped in a sheet of paper that vaguely smelled like wet cardboard. The sandwich was also lukewarm and not hot. Likewise there was a distinct lack of crispiness - more like a mush of breading on the sandwich. The bun was slightly chewy in texture and sweet. Even so, the sandwich was seasoned decently. 

Verdict? I'm going to have to find a proper spicy chicken sandwich to retest this.

325,Popeyes,2.0,"This is a location that is on my route when I am doing curbside pickups, etc. I had the Spicy Chicken Sandwich at another location and it was not too bad for fast food. I stopped here as The Lady was on the mend from an injury and wanted me to pick up something for lunch.

Well, the drive through was jammed, but I had not been at this location before and I wanted to see the preparation, handling, masks, gloves, etc. for the order. So, I thought what they hey, I might as well get one also as I was not going to have time to get a nutritious Chicharron taco on the way home.

So with my mask on, carrying my sanitizer, in I went. Tables were spaced out and I was alone. The manager, who was wearing a mask as were all the other staff, was trying to get the touchless pay pad at the front to work. He was struggling as hard as he could and had been on hold to their tech people, but he still tried to take care of me. I could pay cash if I wanted to order inside. OK, did that.

The order was out in less than 60 seconds. These were whole pieces, looked premade, slopped in a sauce, and crammed into the little weird bag that is used to try and keep them worm. I got home, they were soggy, like left out in the rain, kind of thrown together, so I took the chicken out and reheated just the chicken, replaced, cut the sandwiches, and we proceeded to eat. Not good. Not horrible, but The Lady only ate part of hers. 

So to the rating. 1 Star definitely for their efforts in enforcing C-19 worries.   Everyone I saw who got near food had gloves, all had masks, sanitizer was present, no straws or napkins for others to handle, (they gave it to you from behind the counter). The 2nd Star was for the customer service. The workers, understaffed, were working their hearts out for the long drive up line, and the manager's quick response to get me served was solid.

Should have taken a picture but wing was very dry and bland, red beans were watery and  the sandwich was also dry.

I am not a fast food fan, but she has only been out of the house a couple of times since the virus time began, so, OK, we can go there but how about (named several other places to no avail).  Off we go. Only a couple of miles where we be located. We arrived at 1158 :-( which meant lunch rush. There was no eating inside of course, but they were doing a caravan of cars in the drive up and pickup. We sat in the drive up, and waited and waited. Vehicle after vehicle would take an eternity making up their mind and making multiple changes. This did have one benefit as by the time they pulled up to the window the orders were almost immediately ready. The Lady had the new Spicy Chicken Sandwich, and I got the same thing but had the combo with coleslaw and a Dr. Pepper.

The sandwich is a waste of money. Road Gizzards would have been much better but that is not offered. While spicy, in our eyes it totally missed the mark. Do we plan on another? No. The coleslaw was quite good as was the Dr. Pepper. So one star there and none for the sandwich. We did eat it all as we were hungry, but friend, there are better sandwiches out there.

394,Popeyes,3.0,"This Popeye's gets the highest reviews in town, and the one near me is sloowwwww.  This one wasn't too far from my route that day, and I've been wanting to try the much-hyped sandwich.  Well, kinda.  I didn't want to fight crowds, and I knew it was probably not the best thing since sliced bread.  But, I was curious.  So, I waited, and then took a chance.

I don't much like chicken sandwiches, at least those like this that are tenders on a bun.  They're not structurally sound, so stuff slides around.  If I get a chicken sandwich I tend to get a Wendy's-style, single piece one.  Still, I had to try this.  And it was pretty good.  Two big, thick, tender, uh, tenders, on a decent bun.  I got spicy, which I thought meant the flavoring would be in the meat, but it was a sauce/relish.  It was moderately spicy, not super hot.  A couple of pickle slices added variety and not much else.  The tenders themselves were very good, and stayed together till about halfway through the sandwich, when it all came apart.  I'd rather just have the tenders, especially if I'm eating in the car.

Sided with my choice of red beans and rice, pretty good for a fast food chain.  Sweet tea was very sweet and tasty.  Service was friendly, and super fast. No wait at 2pm.  Place was clean.  Decent access from the road and highway.  There is a door on the right side, though it is hidden; walk around the corner toward the drive-through.  I almost missed it.

I ordered it as is with no exceptions or substitutions.  The sandwich is big, the piece of chicken looks huge in comparison to other chicken sandwiches offered at fast food places.  After my first bite I was hooked.  The breading is crispy and the chicken was hot (not too hot, just perfect).  There were two different sauces on the bottom of the sandwich was a load of mayo with pickles.  The top sauce was something like a mild cajun seasoning.  I didn't ask what it was, as I said, I just ordered the sandwich as is.  The flavors are great together.  I will say, this is definitely the best chicken sandwich I have had from a fast food restaurant.  With that being said, I don't think that all that mayo is at all good for you.  I don't typically do fast food because it overall isn't good for my health, but if I get a hankering for a chicken sandwich I wouldn't put it past me to order a Popeye's chicken sandwich, I will just get it without the mayo and potentially with the other sauce, to cut some calories.

426,Popeyes,1.0,"Always great chicken (obviously), but leadership can ruin everything :-(

Regarding the lead promo on the app as of tonight: Get a Free Chicken Sandwich with Purchase of $10 or more (one per day)

I got a pop--up on my phone this morning that said I could get a free chicken sandwich with $10 purchase. I planned my entire day around it, did my FM shopping across the street timed perfectly to get me in and out by 6:30 before they got crushed. I ordered on the app. I use it all the time. We experienced no hiccups ordering. Except I picked the 3 piece dinner with biscuit and one side (beans and rice) and no drink, so the total was only $9.39. Proof that I had added the promotional sandwich to my cart came when it said I couldn't check out using that promotion as it was under $10 total. So I added an additional $3.99 chicken sandwich to the order, and it worked fine. I had the 3 piece chicken, one biscuit, and one beans and rice (which by the way was never included in the order once I got it home), and one $3.99 chicken sandwich on the ""ticket"" (receipt). The promotional sandwich was not visible, but that didn't bother me since it is free, and therefore not in the total charged. And because, not only did I start the entire order by clicking the picture of the promotion on the app, but I was denied checkout before hitting the minimum requirement of $10 in order to get the promotional free sandwich.

The order was ready so fast that it was sitting in a bag on the counter when I arrived 3 minutes later. But no one ever called my name. They were all frantically busy, but I thought they'd call out my name. I only waited 13 minutes before someone asked me my name, and they said it was already sitting there the whole time.

But the free sandwich wasn't there & I was told they wouldn't give it to me. So I asked to see the boss man.

I can't remember his name tag now, but he said he is the franchisee, so the owner.

I explained what happened, and to my shock, he said his store was not honoring that coupon. It stinks for him that corporate would have the #1 leading add on their country-wide app be a promo that certain stores cannot honor. I fully believe him, BUT as a company owner of a retail store, I also understand that, while it sucks, you just HAVE to honor the corporate coupon. I said he could just write it off. And he said that he could not, that ""they"" take it out of his profits. That blows (if it's true). But I calmly (at first) explained to him that if he could just think from my perspective: Even if it costs you $3.99 (cost would actually be only a buck and change or less), that the reward is the loyalty of a repeat customer (which is evidenced by my order history), and that customer will tell others, etc.  That is the ONLY ""Right"" thing to do. It's literally common sense. If you're a business owner, it's 101.

Instead, he just kept showing me the ticket and saying that if it's not on the ticket, it's not part of the order. Makes sense. But it's not my job to understand how their POS system works or receipt printers.

At this point, I was SO flustered that I said I wanted my ""free f**** sandwich"". I wish I had not stooped so low! He now changed his story that NOW he wouldn't because I cursed. I apologized, but also told him his mask was positioned well below his nose. Common sense is not his strong suit. So he told me, and I'm quoting, ""If I touch my mask I have to change my gloves, and you're the one keeping me here"". This gross flaw in logic had me stymied, so it didn't even occur to me to help him. (i.e. of course you can just change your gloves. You'll have to anyway.) Also, if it slips down just from standing in one place talking with one person, then it MUST be slipping down all the time. This means that not only are his Popeye's employees at risk all around him, but customers certainly are as well.

Disdain for customers aside, he needs to understand how business works. He didn't ""lose"" me because the chicken is great. But it ruined my previously perfect first day off in months :(",  Always great chicken obviously leadership ruin everything Regarding lead promo app tonight Get Free Chicken Sandwich Purchase one per day get pop phone morning say could get free chicken sandwich purchase plan entire day around FM shopping across street time perfectly get get crush order app use time experience hiccup order Except pick piece dinner biscuit one side bean rice drink total Proof add promotional sandwich cart come say check use promotion total add additional chicken sandwich order work fine piece chicken one biscuit one bean rice way never include order get home one chicken sandwich ticket receipt promotional sandwich visible bother since free therefore total charge start entire order click picture promotion app deny checkout hit minimum requirement order get promotional free sandwich order ready fast sit bag counter arrive minute later one ever call name frantically busy think call name wait minute someone ask name say already sit whole time free sandwich tell give ask see bos man remember name tag say franchisee owner explain happen shock say store honor coupon stink corporate would lead add country wide app promo certain store honor fully believe company owner retail store also understand suck honor corporate coupon say could write say could take profit blow true calmly first explain could think perspective Even cost cost would actually buck change less reward loyalty repeat customer evidence order history customer tell others etc Right thing literally common sense business owner Instead keep show ticket say ticket part order Makes sense job understand POS system work receipt printer point flustered say want free f sandwich wish stoop low change story curse apologize also tell mask position well nose Common sense strong suit tell quote touch mask change glove one keep gross flaw logic stymie even occur help e course change glove anyway Also slip stand one place talk one person MUST slip time mean Popeye employee risk around customer certainly well Disdain customer aside need understand business work lose chicken great ruin previously perfect first day month,0.08119824016563147,Positive

The Taco Bell fare is horribly assembled, sometimes half out of the tortilla. The folks working there can barely even stuff a burrito supreme. Further, the freshness of the veggies and the tortillas is horrible, even by Taco bell standards.

Now, I don't know if KFC just hired models with the world's smallest hands for their commercials or they straight up pulled some false advertising, but this sandwich looks BIG on TV, and is teeny tiny in reality.

They rave about the bun that it's on, but it ultimately dominates the flavor of the sandwich.   It's too sweet, and with the chicken breast being smaller than advertised, all you taste is bun.

So, that sandwich gets a 1-out-of-5 stars for me.  The only redeeming points were the mac-n-cheese (got it as a side instead of fries) and their hot sauce (surprisingly good).

489,KFC,4.0,"I give this KFC franchise store 4 stars. FOR TUESDAY CHICKEN DEAL*

-Most people go to KFC for Tuesday Special, so it is very important for this store to be prepared for the long line-up and stocked up on the spicy flavor. This store has done that during the busy hours but not during the last few hours which is understandable.

-The store is generally clean with just a bit of mess at the soft drink dispenser.

-Customer service is exceptional. During my visits, most of the time, the front counter staffs are really nice and welcoming. My orders are always correct and delivered within a reasonable waiting time.

-Now, let's talk CHICKEN! Juicy, crispy and spicy!  The chicken thigh & drum are supposed to be the best in any Fried Chicken store. So these are the food items that make KFC good. The flavor from the thigh & drum in this KFC store taste pretty good to me when compared to the chicken I got from Church's...However, the chicken sandwich wasn't so nice...the chicken that I got in the sandwich actually had squished up skins and look whitish...it had some weird taste...definitely not the normal yum taste from just the separate chicken thigh & drums.

I would recommend this KFC store in the Broadmoor Village, because it has pretty consistent flavor for the chicken thigh & drum separate pieces.

I left with a bag of crunchy beef tacos, and no sauce. It's a bad sign when they are out of taco bell sauce at taco bell. The tacos sucked worse than I expected, even for tacosmell.

I've always been a fan of KFC original recipe chicken; I find the crispy version flavorless. I usually don't order sandwiches, because I associate them with the awful ones served at Chick-fil-A. But I do like to put potato chips into any sandwich, and I like Cheetos. So...

Of course I had to try this new item at KFC, and I really liked it. The chicken is moist and flavorful with a nice crunchy coating, and the Cheetos add even more crunch. Mayo gives it a creamy consistency, and there is an orange sauce that might be intended to be hot sauce, but I would have liked to be spicier.

Overall I enjoyed the sandwich and would have it again.

The chicken was tender and juicy, perfectly KFC fried and could be near perfect but unfortunately this sandwich had too much Mayo for my taste. The pickles were crisp and enhanced the flavor of the sandwich well. Simple and plentiful. So, why the 3 stars?

I've been back home for three days now. Everything seems like it's blurring together, life is happening so fast. I know I'm going to be back at my apartment soon, and it's all going to feel like a dream, but I know it's not. I haven't dreamed in months. I stop at a KFC on the way to my dad's house, I order 3 chicken sandwiches because they are easy to eat in the car while driving, I inhale the first two before I even get back on to the highway. 

(Please wait a moment )
(Give them time to drop off your order. You'll get an alert when it's there.)

I glair out my window onto the street below, the sun shining into my bloodshot eyes triggering my pounding headache with images of throwing up into my toilet last night from one-two many shots and a stomach on empty.

[it's 2009]
I'm taking my break between my double shift while working at a Firehouse Subs and decided I want to go try the KFC Double Down™. I decided to double down on the order, And get two. I sit in my car and eat alone, the album I've been listening to on repeat has drilled to the center of my brain and will probably never leave me. 

(It's here )
(Grab your order at the door, and don't forget to rate and tip.)

[it's 2016]
I'm in North Georgia with some friends going camping. We stop at a KFC to try out the Nashville Style Hot Chicken tender bucket. We are planing an extensive hike for later in the year and decided it would be interesting to have hot chicken shits in the woods and a test for the future. [1]

I run down the flight of stairs and arrive at the front door, I can feel the sun baking my legs as light pour into the room. I notice specks of red vomit splattered on my calf's, like blood from a fallen angle covering me.

(How was your order?)

I venture back into my bubble, safe from the outside dimension, but left up fully to my own devices.

I've been rewatching Bojack horseman, seems fitting for the time. I hit play as I stuff my face with whipped potatoes, bits of fried chicken, corn, and cheese all swimming in a pool of grease and chili powder. Like a feral animal, I lick the bowl clean, and start on the next bowl of empty bliss. 

I've chosen this life, for better or worse.

519,Wendy's,1.0,"Worst service ever! A couple of days ago I order a chicken sandwich and a double (No Cheese) went over the order twice and corrected them when they repeated the order the first time. The chicken was very dry. It was like trying to chew on a shoe sole. The double, of course, had cheese on it. It was so frustrating. I decided to call and complain to the manager. I spoke with GM Sean. Sean was very apologetic. He admitted that they have been having issues with the Homestyle Chicken being too dry. He said he was very sorry that my order was filled incorrectly and invited me to have my next meal free. I asked if there is some incident number I needed to give them. Sean said, just tell them sean said to give you a free order and they would be happy to give it to you.
Well... Today I decided to take Sean up on his offer.  They take my order and ask me to pull forward because it will take 6 minutes for a fresh sandwich. sean was not in but another manager was there. I told her Sean told me that the order was to be free but to my surprise, a minute later she sends a young man to have me pull back around so I can pay for the balance of my order. When I got back to the order window she started arguing with me.  She said she can ""replace"" my chicken sandwich because it was dry but she was not going to take care of my burger too. I could not believe the audacity of this young woman. I thanked her for her time and suggested she keep her food. I will never come back to Wendy's.

But the chicken on that chicken sandwich was almost invisible.  After I remove half the bread from the sandwich so it fit that tiny patty, I basically paid ten dollars for a chicken slider.  I could have gone to a sit down restaurant for these prices.

524,Wendy's,4.0,"If you follow my reviews, you will know that Wendy's is one of my favorite fast food restaurants for their ""better quality"" fast food.  I'm not talking about the value items, but specifically about their salads and premium chicken sandwiches.

I have been to this particular Wendy's several times while visiting different friends who live nearby.  However, I've only been through the drive-thru, so I'm not sure what the inside looks like.  Most recently, I went through the drive-thru here around 7 pm on a Friday while I was on my way to a friend's place nearby.  I ordered my favorite meal - the Spicy Chicken Fillet Sandwich Combo ($6.09 for the ""Small"" combo).

There were two cars in front of me, and although it felt like it took a long time to finally get to the pickup window after ordering and paying, it actually took about 5 minutes from the time I ordered to the time I got my food.  I asked for two sauces - a Buttermilk Ranch and BBQ sauce (so delicious when they're mixed together!), which I always dip my fries in.  Some Wendy's restaurants actually charge for sauce (unless you order chicken nuggets), but this one doesn't.  I always appreciate that.  =)

When I arrived at my friend's place to eat about 10 minutes later, my sandwich and fries were still pretty hot.  I enjoyed my meal and was, for the most part, satisfied.  The only suggestion I have for this Wendy's - and perhaps all Wendy's in general - if for them to PLEASE get Coke Zero as one of their fountain drink options!  I recall when I was living in L.A., they served Coke Zero for a while, and then they stopped.  Please bring Coke Zero back!

Overall, this Wendy's gets 4 stars for their fairly quick, friendly service and delicious food.  I will definitely return to this Wendy's time and time again when I'm hanging out with friends who live in the area.

528,Wendy's,2.0,"Out of the big three in the fast sorta-food market Wendy's is the best, or the closest to actual food. We know it. After all, it's a hometown product and proves the Columbus rules the sorta-food category.  

I know I don't mind Wendy's, their 'spicy' chicken sandwich is pretty delicious. I stopped by for just a little bite seeing their 4 for $4 deal: a Junior bacon cheeseburger, small fry, small nugget, and soda. It totals at $4.30 with tax. 

This location like others has undergone remodeling, ditching the bland interior for something you actual might want to eat in; glass, TV, a fireplace, pseudo-upscale seating attempting to stem the loss of clientele by the fast-causal competition. All this is nice but is ultimately worthless if fundamentals are lacking. 

In my trip here fundamentals were lacking. 

1.) All the pleasing interior designs in the world will fail if much of a customer's experience is spent watching the employees work in their miserable assembly line of bells, whistles and alarms.  This is due when the line overwhelms the system and the customer ( that's me on this trip) has to stand and wait for his food, doing nothing but watching the staff hustle among their machines and food parts.  How about a number system where we could at least enjoy the new fancy dining room instead of standing and feeling odd? 

2.) The cashiers need to listen: I said ""for here,"" not ""to go."" I was forced to just eat out of the bag. This is not a critical error, and if it wasn't busy I would had corrected at the counter. But it is a pet peeve and something so simple.

3.) Nothing says low quality than the soda machine having no ice and for the soda to be hooked-up wrong and be flat. Uggg.

4.) though not all that bad, the place was pretty dirty with crumbs in the carpet and straw wrappers tossing about like tumbleweeds.

Surprisingly nice. I normally avoid Wendy's like the plague but decided to pop into this one after it's recent remodel.

They consistently get orders wrong in the drive through to the point where now it almost seems like they are doing it on purpose.

How do you mistake a strawberry salad for a BBQ ranch salad. It showed up on the screen correctly. Where did you go wrong?

How do you put ""no tomato no ketchup"" on BOTH sandwiches on the screen yet put them on the sandwiches anyway. (allergies to tomato. thanks).

Does spicy chicken sandwich suddenly translate to fish fillet? I guess it does.

By Dave Thomas's square-cut paddies, it's like a stepping into the Twilight Zone of fast food!

While there were no obvious health code violations or anything else snotty, the lady taking all the orders--yes, ""lady"" singular--and the staff in the back were like zombies.  Customers had to repeat orders three and four times while the cashier moved at agonizing speeds to tap the right buttons on the register.  The workers in the back seemed to have developed selective deafness for various timers, because they had absolutely no urgency to turn them off or to take care of the orders.  After over 10 minutes of waiting I considered getting back in my car, going through the drive-thru, and wiping the experience from my mind, but I powered through it.

To her credit, the cashier quickly took and retrieved the order for my small #7, though she did struggle at the ""and a package of honey mustard"" part.  Within the next 3 minutes I was leaving with a chicken sandwich, luke-warm fries, and a Coke.  13 minutes inside.

556,Wendy's,2.0,"This is a summary of my expericence at this Wendy's location for the past 6 months.    
The food is very much the standard Wendy's fair.    Depends on when you visit and who is working, you get either nice and fresh burgers, fries, chicken sandwichs, and chicken nuggets or you get something that seemed to have been sitting there for hours.    For the most part, the food is fine.  
The service at this location is what ultimately drives me away for good.    Out of the 7 to 8 times I have frequented this place, the folks behind the counters are always less than pleasant.     I have been short-changed 3 times when paying with cash.   I can see it was only 0.10 to 0.50 each time, but imagine if they do that to every other customer each day, they are ending up with stealing more than $100 a day in change.     
One time, I was overcharge for an additional burger, they only wanted to refund me the exact amount of the burger, but not the taxes that they had also charged me.    I tried to get the counter-person to understand that when she charged me for an extra burger that I did not order or want, she had also charged me for taxes related to that burger.     She then said she can't open the register to give me my full refund until someone else buys something.    I waited for another customer to buy something before she gave me my money back.    The worst part of it was that she didn't immediately give me my money back, she made me wait until she took care of the other customer and made me feel as if I was wrong,
The last straw came when I bought a meal that was listed for one price, but it rung up for $0.50 more.  So I basically charged $0.54 more for the same item that was advertised.  (No, I did not up size and the price that rung up was not for any up-size)   I told the counter person that their price list indicated this meal would cost such amount as advertised, the price is right there for he and I to see.   He said, sorry, I can't do nothing, it rung up as charged.     I asked to speak with a manager.   He came to the front and asked what is the problem.   After explaining the ""problem"" to him,  there was no apology, he just handed me $0.54.     This leads me to think they know exactly what they are doing at this location,  scamming unsuspecting customers by either short-changing them or by charging more for advertised items.    I had told him that they advertised one price and their registered rung up a different price and that seems kind of unfair and he should fix that.   He said he can't do anything about it.

574,Wendy's,2.0,"I don't see much point in reviewing chain fast food places, as you know what you're going to get. But this place is close to the office and who doesn't want a spicy chicken sandwich every once in a while?

Except this restaurant is severely understaffed, usually with a single person taking orders for both the drive through and customers in line. It takes a while, and you'll be ignored. I've also had numerous issues with the food, either getting the wrong thing, waiting an inordinate amount of time, and once getting a raw chicken sandwich. So you stand around waiting for that one employee to finally get back to you then get your order right, again after a ridiculously long wait. The understaffing also means the restaurant itself is usually dirty, or there's no ketchup or straws or napkins.

But what prompted me to write today were the aggressive panhandlers INSIDE the place. I was hounded by a woman for money to the point I had to leave, and no one from the restaurant would help out. I offered to buy her some food, but she only wanted money. Would I drive her to the ATM and give her $20? No, I won't. She had a friend outside and the two followed me to my car, verbally abusing me.

575,Wendy's,1.0,"I don't even know where to begin. My boyfriend & I witnessed every display of poor customer service in one sitting. We went to this location last night. When we pulled up the drive through line was wrapped around the building so, being a Saturday night we just assumed they were busy so we went inside to eat. At first I was displeased with the monotone, unfriendly vibe I got from the girl behind the counter when we ordered our food but after this horrible experience I ended up feeling bad for the girl because she was basically running the whole place by herself. We ordered or food at 8:54 PM & our fries were brought out after 5 minutes. They have one of those fancy pop machines with the 100 different flavors but none of the flavors were actually available & the pop tasted weird. 15 minutes passed and we were still waiting on our sandwiches. Meanwhile, there were 3 employees standing by the drive thru window not doing a single thing! One of the girls was staring off into space with her HANDS DOWN HER SHIRT, SCRATCHING HER BOOB! The kid who was making the sandwiches was moving at a snails pace & I watched it take him 5 minutes to make a small cheeseburger for the drive thru. Then he WIPED SWEAT OFF HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS HAND & CONTINUED TO MAKE THE DRIVE THRU FOOD! (Luckily he did not make our food & i watched like a hawk while they made our food later) While this is all going on, a manager walks up to another employee & starts talking bad about a man in the drive thru who was upset because he got over charged for his food! IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS! Calling the guy crazy & this & that. Instead of doing his job as a manager & addressing the issue he continued to run his mouth about this man. At this point the line was wrapped around the building for both the drive thru & inside. 25 minutes had passed & we still did not get our sandwiches. The girl who took our order noticed and SHE had to say something to the MANAGER! He then rolled his eyes & gave nothing but attitude about having to do his job. No apology from him, just from the clerk. The 3 other employees were still standing back there doing absolutely nothing. When we FINALLY got our food & sat down to eat our fries were freezing cold, my chicken sandwich was extremely dry & unappetizing, my boyfriend's burger was not cooked through (lucky for them he likes a little pink in the middle but it's still not normal for Wendy's)  before we left my boyfriend went to the restroom & when he came back he looked extremely mad & grossed when I asked what was wrong he said the bathrooms were absolutely DISGUSTING. We left & went to the movies & when we drove back from the movies at 12:45 AM, the line for the drive thru was STILL wrapped around the building. I just am in shock & awe over what we experienced at this location. It is a very convenient location, being right by our house but now we don't know if we ever even want to go back to this store.

576,Wendy's,4.0,"I sometimes ask myself why I bother to write about a chain fast food place, they are supposed to be cookie-cutter restaurants where you get the same thing at every single one across this great land of ours.  Hence, you should be able to say that a Wendy's is a Wendy's is a Wendy's.  Or are they? (picture one eyebrow arching up like Leonard Nimoy). 

The Japanese are credited with saying that a fish starts to stink from the head. actually the earliest known use of the term was by a Greek named Erasmus in 1546.  Obviously that means that if the leadership is bad what does that say about the crew under him or her?  I have been to some bad Wendy's and some that fluctuate, but this Wendy's has been amazingly constant since I started going there in 2002.  They don't stink.

Today however was a new level of awesome.  As you may know I am recovering from surgery and am on a knee scooter.  The Official Mother of this Elite and I stopped for something to eat, she a salad and me a spicy chicken sandwich.  As we filled our cups with soda the cashier had our food ready.  Mom had the drinks in her hands and if you ever try to carry much on a knee scooter you know it's a recipe for disaster.  Mom, carrying our drinks said she would be right back up for the food, but the cashier, even with people in line took a moment and brought our trays out to us without being asked.  That is awesome in my book.

Other great things about this Wendy's is they now have a Freestyle Coke machine with scads of low calorie options!  The bathroom is always clean.  Handicapped parking is well maintained.

I get that it's a fast food restaurant that employs kids that ostensibly only care for the paycheck and don't think so quick on their feet...but WOW! Management apparently falls in the same category. Snarky attitudes, hardly any smiles, and apathetic attitudes from folks with a poor self image problem permeate this atmosphere.

I tried asking how long it would take not for my order but to prepare a certain grilled chicken sandwich. As some places prepare these very kinds of items as they are ordered and tend to need extra time to prepare.

600,Wendy's,3.0,"Very seldom do I go to Wendy's twice in a week. Let alone two days in a row. But having my car serviced at the nearby Tires Plus, I decided to walk over for lunch. I had been to a Wendy's on the day before. This location, on the corner of Hoffner and Conway, is convenient if you are having your car serviced at the automotive shop mentioned. I have been here a few times, and never have I had any problem in regards to service, food, or cleanliness. And when I have been here, there is a constant flow of customers. Either dining in or getting an order from the drive through window. They must be doing something right.
Whenever I go to Wendy's, I always order the hamburger. But since I had a Wendy's hamburger the day before, I decided to give the new Tuscan Chicken sandwich a try.
The Tuscan Chicken sandwich is a chicken breast served on a Ciabatta roll and topped with asiago cheese. My chicken breast was breaded and spicy. As to whether you can order the breast grilled, I am sorry to tell you that I did not think to ask or look at the menu more closely. It is topped with lettuce and a garlic and roasted tomato aioli, giving the sandwich a more zesty taste rather than the everyday mayo or mustard. Aioli is a spread that consists of spices, oils, and roasted vegetables, such as tomato or red pepper.
Along with the sandwich, I had my usual medium drink and medium order of french fries. Plus a small chocolate Frosty. I think there is a unwritten law somewhere that says you must order a Frosty with every meal you buy at Wendy's. I don't know how true that is, but it works for me! My total for lunch came up to $8.93.
My sandwich was delicious. And I would recommend that if you do find yourself going in to a Wendy's, give this sandwich a try. I would love to have the recipe for the garlic and roasted tomato aioli.
I had finished my lunch and decided to stay for a little bit and read while my car was being worked on. This Wendy's location does not have a soda fountain where you can serve yourself. You have to ask the employees for a refill. They were more than happy to refill my drink, and the management and staff had no problem with me taking my time to leave. I guess if there is plenty of tables and you are not causing a problem, that is fine. I have been to other restaurants in which they are in a hurry to get you to leave. 
If there was any problem with this Wendy's, it would have been the bathroom. There were paper towels all over the floor. But that is more of a problem regarding a few customers. When  business was slow, a few employees came out to wipe down tables, take out the trash, and clean the bathrooms. Any Wendy's I have been to always seems to make cleanliness a priority.
The next time I have my vehicle service, or if I just happen to be nearby, I'll gladly stop in again at this Wendy's. And when I do, I might just get me another Tuscan Chicken.",  seldom go Wendy twice week Let alone two day row car service nearby Tires Plus decide walk lunch Wendy day location corner Hoffner Conway convenient car service automotive shop mention time never problem regard service food cleanliness constant flow customer Either din get order drive window must something right Whenever go Wendy always order hamburger since Wendy hamburger day decide give new Tuscan Chicken sandwich try Tuscan Chicken sandwich chicken breast serve Ciabatta roll top asiago cheese chicken breast bread spicy whether order breast grill sorry tell think ask look menu closely top lettuce garlic roast tomato aioli give sandwich zesty taste rather everyday mayo mustard Aioli spread consist spice oil roast vegetable tomato red pepper Along sandwich usual medium drink medium order french fry Plus small chocolate Frosty think unwritten law somewhere say must order Frosty every meal buy Wendy know true work total lunch come sandwich delicious would recommend find go Wendy give sandwich try would love recipe garlic roast tomato aioli finish lunch decide stay little bit read car work Wendy location soda fountain serve ask employee refill happy refill drink management staff problem take time leave guess plenty table cause problem fine restaurant hurry get leave problem Wendy would bathroom paper towel floor problem regard customer business slow employee come wipe table take trash clean bathroom Wendy always seem make cleanliness priority next time vehicle service happen nearby gladly stop Wendy might get another Tuscan Chicken,0.024737453904120566,Neutral

616,Wendy's,4.0,"I've been through the drive-thru of this Wendy's a few times, but I've never dined inside.  Nevertheless, it's my absolute favorite Wendy's to date!  Why?  Because not only do they serve my favorite fast food chicken sandwich, they also have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine!  This means I can get my favorite soda - Raspberry-flavored Coke Zero!  =)

Most days when I'm in the mood for Wendy's, it's because I'm craving the Spicy Chicken Fillet Sandwich.  As previously mentioned, Coke Zero is my favorite beverage - probably of all time - and I love that you can get it flavored is so many ways, including (but not limited to) Raspberry, Cherry, Vanilla, Orange, etc.  Wonderful.  Why can't all Wendy's have Freestyle machines?!

The Spicy Chicken Fillet Sandwich and fries (combo = $6.25, including tax) are always served hot and delicious here.  I always get the Ranch and BBQ sauces to dip my fries in.  Mmmm - sooo good!

During my most recent drive-thru experience here, I noticed there was a small sign on one of the pick-up windows indicating that if you make a $1 donation to the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, you'll get a Frosty-shaped key tag to attach to your key chain.  This allows you to get one free Jr. Frosty per visit with any purchase at Wendy's.  I thought this was awesome and told the employee that I wanted to make the $1 donation for a key tag.  However, the employee informed me that this is only valid at participating Wendy's, possibly only Corporate-owned restaurants, which apparently this one is.  That was totally fine by me.

Overall, this Wendy's gets 4.5 stars for their consistently wonderful (better than) fast food, fairly short wait time in the drive-thru, and awesome Coke Freestyle machine!  I can't emphasize enough how much I love that they have the machine because all the other Wendy's I have been to in Georgia don't serve Coke Zero at all!  Since this is the closest Wendy's to work, I'm sure I will continue to utilize their drive-thru on a regular basis.  Free Jr. Frosties for the rest of this year!!!  =)

The woman in front of me was at the window  for so long I found myself cursing...damn lady how much friggin food do you need, but then I noticed her staring back through the side window as if to say... hey! no one's here, so just lay off.  She gave up and drove off.  I went to the speaker waited a bit and then a very exasperated voice came over the speaker asking for my patience, it would be just a minute.  He came back and I ordered, jr bacon cheese, Monterrey chicken sandwich and sm fry.  (yes I am still trying to lose weight and the chicken was a last minute addition -i left my wallet at home and was working off of the dollar menu...it's a new item...I wanted to try it....ANYWAY.)  A large middle aged  guy who looked like he wanted to shoot me, ""Wendy""  herself, the world for making him work this shit can job and definitely his jherri curled supervisor standing directly behind him frowning ...handed me a large red drink. I handed it back... yes I took it...I would have appreciated a nice complimentary coke or tea but not fruit punch.  His supervisors eyes narrowed as it became clear he had made yet another mistake.  Yes you did he insists, his polite voice having disappeared.  You ordered a jr bacon cheese, a chicken sandwich and a large fruit punch.  I shook my head.  I repeated my order with the fries as he glared at me nastily refusing to take the drink his expression saying, I know you ordered that damn jungle juice-. Just f*ing take it. nope. Don't want it. I would have just kept it but still I needed my fries.  He finally relented, the polite voice returned and he came back with fries.   When I asked for ketchup he squished the packets into my hands and I knew he wanted nothing more than to slap me in the face with them.  My receipt revealed that I had paid 1.39 for that stupid drink-more than anything on my actual order and I really wanted to go back and get my correct change, but I didn't.  That guy looked like he was on his last leg, and a verbal lashing from Jherri might have sent him over the edge over a few cents.
Long story short, the service here sucks.  I returned some nuggets once and when my replacement was a few cents more the idiot at the counter insisted that I pay the difference.  For 11 cents?  When I sarcastically handed her my debit card the fool actually started to process the charge until her manager came over and just gave me my food.

I then ordered a crispy chicken sandwich and a double stack. The chicken was not crispy, although it probably was at one time. The lettuce was limp and it tasted like there was no mayo on it, but looking for it, you could see there was some mayo that was sparsely spread on it. 
I knew the burgers on the double stack were going to be small which is why I ordered the double stack. They were very small!  But that's not what the real problem was. They looked old.

657,Wendy's,4.0,"ok, it's Wendy's.  I know.

I rarely eat at Wendy's but have been pretty tired of cooking lately, so I decided to get something quick, easy and drive-thru.  

I checked out their website, to refresh my memory of their offerings and their new ""W"" caught my eye.  

In the past, I have not been a fan of Wendy's burgers, preferring their chicken sandwiches, but then a few years ago, I stopped even liking those.

Anyhow, I went to Wendy's, got the combo #6 (I do believe) which is the new ""W' cheeseburger, fries and a drink.

For a fast food burger, the ""W"" was quite tasty!  I was super impressed!  I liked the amount of beef, cheese and condiments.  I would definitely eat that again, when the burger mood strikes!

I also find their new fries (the natural, sea salt ones) a HUGE improvement over their old fries.  The whole meal was quite pleasant.  

I hope that burger stays on the menu a long time.",  ok Wendy know rarely eat Wendy pretty tire cook lately decide get something quick easy drive thru check website refresh memory offering new W caught eye past fan Wendy burger prefer chicken sandwich year ago stop even like Anyhow go Wendy get combo believe new W cheeseburger fry drink fast food burger W quite tasty super impressed like amount beef cheese condiment would definitely eat burger mood strike also find new fry natural sea salt one HUGE improvement old fry whole meal quite pleasant hope burger stay menu long time,0.1948773448773449,Positive

660,Wendy's,1.0,"3 of us went to this Wendy's a couple nights ago. We went to the drive through because the inside was closed. As we were leaving the parking lot and getting our food from the bags we realized we were given a burger instead of a chicken sandwich and were not given our medium fries. We wanted to check the receipt to see if we were still charged for the fries and realized we were not given our receipt or my card back. We turned around to go back and get my card. We parked in the parking lot not even 2 minutes after we left and saw the girl that had just cashed us out (who didn't give my card back) get in her car and speed off. We walked up to the drive through window and told the other lady that we weren't given our card back and that we also weren't given our correct order (which didn't really matter) she tried looking for the card and couldn't find it. She gave us the food that we were missing (the fries tasted like some kind of chemical had spilled on them) and she called the girl who had just gone on break. The girl came back and sped into the parking lot so fast she almost hit my boyfriend, the girl inside the window had to scream for him to watch out. She got out of the car yelling and swearing and went inside. When she came to the window she said ""are you sure I didn't give you your card?"" I said I was positive and told her and the other girl several times the color of my card, my name and the name of the bank it said on it. They then said they found my card and tried to hand me a red credit card with the name Ashley on it. The girl said she would have her manager check the camera in the morning to see what happened to my card and give me a call to let me know. I waited until afternoon the next day and then called to ask to speak to the manager. They went to get the manager and I could hear them just talking in the background saying they had 3 cards from the drive through that night! How are 3 cards not given back?? I was on the phone for 7 minutes and then was told they don't have my card and hung up. I was already aware they didn't have my card they said they would check the cameras to find it. I called corporate they were very nice and helpful and said the general manager would be in touch with me. I just got a voicemail from the general manager telling me they don't have my card. I have already called to cancel my card but would like to know what happened to it.

668,Wendy's,1.0,"The start of the experience was negative in the fact that the credit card machines were down in the restaurant, and they were only accepting cash. I understand that these things happen, so this in NO WAY reflects the rating I have given this store. However, when we placed our order, we needed to have two items removed from the order due to insufficient funds (cash only - no plastic), in which the manager on duty came out extremely rude and removed the items, then disappeared to the kitchen. We asked another question  to the sweet cashier, which apparently the ""manager"" overheard incorrectly and she loudly shouted from the back ""Do they want something else taken off now?"" as if we had inconvenienced her so drastically on a quiet night in which sales would most certainly be down. I could not even control my laughter as I was so surprised at the rudeness of a person in charge of leading others and setting an example. We finally received our food after an uncharacteristically long wait for a franchised fast food restaurant, and exited the store. The food was extremely poor, and the chicken sandwiches almost inedible as they had been made so long ago. All in all, this was by far the WORST Wendy's I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. I certainly hope they can correct the issues, as they seem to start at the top of this particular store.

I ordered a spicy Asiago chicken sandwich (no tomato) combo with a baked potato and an unsweetened iced tea. The lady that took my order must have been very distracted because she kept asking me over and over to repeat it. When my order came up, there were fries on the tray. I said I had ordered a potato. The server looked confused but then got me a potato. She left the fries on the tray. I looked at my receipt and it had ""small fries"" on it. I was annoyed because I had repeated my order several times to the cashier. I took my tray and went to sit down, but when I unwrapped my sandwich, there was no tomato but there was no Asiago cheese either. Also, it didn't look like the sandwich was correct/it appeared to be the dollar menu chicken sandwich. I took it back to the server behind the counter and said, ""Isn't there supposed to be cheese on this?"" The server looked at the cashier and she said, ""Yes, Asiago chicken club-that's how I rang it up!"" (It was correct on the receipt.) The cashier and the server apologized and the server said she'd make me a new one right away. She dumped the other sandwich in the trash, which made me cringe-I should have told her it to waste it, that I'd take it for later, but oh well. I figured while I was up at the counter I'd ask for for some butter for my potato. Another gentleman behind the counter asked if I'd been given any and I told him no. He seemed surprised. He disappeared for a few minutes and when he returned, he said they didn't have any. None? That seems odd, a restaurant that serves baked potatoes not having any butter. Hmmm.

So, I requested my transaction receipt and the cashier said the second (front) window will have it.

4] When I pulled up to the second (front) window, they initially gave me someone else's order. So, I gave it back and I had to reconfirm my order to someone for a 3rd time. While I was waiting for them to get the right order, another worker came to the window and apologized that they didn't have the syrup for the tea I wanted and asked if I wanted something else. So I got a Limeaid. Well, I got the ""correct"" order, but I still didn't get my transaction receipt. So I requested it a 2nd time and the guy at the front window had to run to the back window to get the receipt. ...Come to find out they put down a ""Small Pear Berry Fruit Tea,"" which they were out of, instead of the Honest Tropical Green Tea that I wanted and a ""Jr. Cheeseburger"" instead of the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger that I wanted.

729,Wendy's,3.0,"I would like to inform any who read this and also the corporate hq of Wendy's that some franchises do not understand the meaning of what is on the back of receipts now days. This not only happens for Wendy's, I have had it happen to me at Rally's, but there needs to be a training program to get everyone standardized. 

I use the back of my receipt and for anyone who knows, one can almost get a BOGO deal off it. Going to the Wendy's locations in my area, I have had it honored with promotional sandwiches as well as regular sandwiches. The only problem is that different locations have their versions of what a customer, like myself, can actually buy.

When I get a coupon in the mail where it states that you can only get a chicken sandwich (Homestyle, Grilled, Spicy) with purchase of another.  it is what it is because it blatantly says it. 

The receipt deal states ""Get a Free Dave's Single or Chicken Sandwich (does not disclose what kind of Chicken sandwich) with the purchase of ANY premium sandwich. So that means anything premium. Well, if you look at premium, it is defined as any sandwich not a value or on the value menu. So any sandwich, even promotional, should be up for grabs. 

In KY, I have had one location (Thunderstick Dr.) tell me that I could not get a spicy chicken sandwich, it had to be Homestyle if I am buying a premium. Sometimes, I would be able to get a promotional sandwich like a S'awesome burger, Peppercorn Mushroom melt, and even a Barbecue Cheeseburger and then get a value item like a Homestyle, as the free and they restrict it to that (but the receipt does not disclose what kind of chicken sandwich...read it). 

At the location I went to tonight, on Richmond Rd., I was told that the new promotional chicken sandwiches like the S'awesome Bacon Chicken, Avocado BLT, and Barbecue Chicken were NOT premium. So what are they considered? 

This is why there needs to be a training because when I see ""ANY premium chicken sandwich, for completing a survey,"" it literally means ANY. 

Until this is figured out, people could essentially be misled and they could have received something they may have had to settle for over a sandwich they actually wanted. So all this survey taking for better customer service goes out the window because receiving an unwanted sandwich IS bad customer service. What is worse is that the sandwich settled for is dictated by the franchise, not corporate. The receipt offers are from corporate right? Because we have to complete the surveys? Why are franchises allowed to dictate the meaning of what sandwich a customer should get?",  would like inform read also corporate hq Wendy franchise understand meaning back receipt day happen Wendy happen Rally need training program get everyone standardize use back receipt anyone know one almost get BOGO deal Going Wendy location area honor promotional sandwich well regular sandwich problem different location version customer like actually buy get coupon mail state get chicken sandwich Homestyle Grilled Spicy purchase another blatantly say receipt deal state Get Free Dave Single Chicken Sandwich disclose kind Chicken sandwich purchase premium sandwich mean anything premium Well look premium define sandwich value value menu sandwich even promotional grab KY one location Thunderstick Dr tell could get spicy chicken sandwich Homestyle buy premium Sometimes would able get promotional sandwich like awesome burger Peppercorn Mushroom melt even Barbecue Cheeseburger get value item like Homestyle free restrict receipt disclose kind chicken sandwich read location go tonight Richmond Rd tell new promotional chicken sandwich like awesome Bacon Chicken Avocado BLT Barbecue Chicken premium consider need training see premium chicken sandwich complete survey literally mean figure people could essentially mislead could receive something may settle sandwich actually want survey take good customer service go window receive unwanted sandwich bad customer service bad sandwich settle dictate franchise corporate receipt offer corporate right complete survey franchise allow dictate meaning sandwich customer get,-0.058766233766233765,Negative
730,Wendy's,1.0,"If only I had been knowledgeable about the internet when my ""experience"" happened at this location some years ago, I could've gotten this out sooner...

I'd like to share with everyone an old story from this location that happened some time in the summer of 2006 or 2007. Me and my cousin were frequent visitors to this restaurant. We ate inside most of the time to enjoy the peace and quiet and often chit-chat with a few of the employees when the impending rush was at a minimum. My family and I ate there for nearly 6 years. The burgers were decent; Spicy Chicken Sandwich gets a 21-gun salute! Never been disappointed with that choice of sandwich. The last time I visited here, me and my cousin ate in. We were awaiting the arrival of the public transportation (M.A.R.T.A). We had some junior bacon cheese burgers and some small sodas. Nothing too heavy, just to hit the spot before we went on our way. Before we planned to depart, my cousin attempted to get another refill after he had already had maybe, 2 or 3 refills when the female manager at the time, refused to do so. I witness this from the dining section, and I'm upset along with him as well. I even went so far as to call the 1-800 number that was on the cup I purchased to verify if this type of treatment was justifiable - basically, to see if she was living up to the policy itself. From what I was told previously in the past: Wendy's customers that dine in (as we did), are allowed unlimited refills, but the thing is: they don't use the same cup your mouth was around, and have to use a whole new cup. Regardless, that female manager violated Wendy's policy on serving paying customers that were dining in! But there's more to this story...

From me and my cousin's observation, we've witnessed customers on ""the lighter skin side of life"", getting far better treatment than us, regular customers. By that, ""those"" people got greeted upon entering, and farewells while leaving. There were times we entered after ""they"" entered, and could hear while the door was opened ""Hi! Welcome to Wendy's!"" but as we entered, silence and glares.

So now you can get a gist of the atmosphere my cousin and I stirred up just by alone, being on the property, even though we never caused absolutely any trouble. Back on track...

   On behalf of my cousin, I went to speak on the matter to the same lady at the counter to tell her she could not do that. She doesn't answer anything I'm saying, just looks at me in disgust and resumes what she's doing. She never asks me to leave, but suddenly a police offer enters the store, and right away, she signals to him that I'm being ""an issue."" He tells me to leave, I try to explain to him for some unknown reason thinking he would be a voice of reason (this would be the last day I have faith in anyone who wore a badge). With an attitude, I proceeded to leave, but had to get my umbrella where my cousin was, the officer then grabs me from behind and delivers the hand of justice to me by forcibly removing me - mind you, those four people in the dining area said that wasn't necessary - I get thrown on the ground, and arrested for Disorderly Conduct. My cousin is patted down outside the store, but only I get arrested.

Restaurants like these with biased mentalities towards customers that aren't ""on the lighter side of life"" need to be reevaluated. I have not returned there since then. Can you blame me? I attempted to reach Wendy's Corporate Office after my ""detention"" was over, but I had no success.

Since this location is close to work I stop by here for a spicy chicken sandwich and plain baked potato for lunches. Scine this is downtown crossing and during lunch I would expect that this place would be in the throws of chaos, but it's well organized with a person standing among the line taking the orders down on an order form, you take the order form to the front to be placed and for you to pay, then quickly move aside. This steam lines the process and keeps things going. 

I can't complain about the food since is is exactly the same as every other Wendy's I have been to.

She says that I probably would have gone through.

Literally if there was a fire she would be the one that you wouldn't want to alert anyone about it; because no one would hear her say fire. I had to repeatedly ask her, what? Over and over and then lean across the counter to try and hear her and then still couldn't hear her. It was a nightmare to order and pay for the meal because of it. 

Third issue, the young man handing out food also couldn't speak up. I had to call out the name he was ""yelling"" out because no one could hear him either. 

Fourth issue, no soda on multiple kinds. I asked for them to fill the Dr Pepper and instead of filling it up they filled it behind counter (that I'm thankful for) but then when we go to refill, we have to ask them to do it again behind counter because they still hadn't replaced it in dining room machine. The second machine wasn't even operating. 

Fifth issue, no small cup lids and no fire in their pants to even fill them up. Our group alone had 10 people that needed that size lid and after an hour of being there they still didn't fill them. That's not including the other customers in there that had to ask for lids also. The manager or someone should have taken a min to fix these minor dining room issues; unless the manager didn't order correctly and they didn't have any to replace. Either way I saw no effort in attempting to even reconcile the issues. 

Sixth issue, the tables were gross and I had to wash my own table/seats down before we could sit. Every single table was nasty  the floor was gross, the trash cans overfilled. Just horrible. 

Seventh issue, one of our orders was a regular grilled chicken sandwich (the only order on this particular ticket) and they gave us some avocado bacon chicken sandwich. We had to have it redone and then wait and wait for it to be done. I believe it should have been pushed to the front of the cue line. 

Eighth issue, our fries were old and over cooked at that. Didn't eat them all. But you have a choice, have them give you new ones and wait even longer for it, eat them or throw them away. I chose throw them away. Not worth it for the other two options. 

Last issue, number nine, they only had 5 people working on a sat afternoon. You can not schedule only 5 people to work on a weekend day. This is most likely why this location is the way it is.

831,Wendy's,4.0,"Howell Mill Wendy's is my neighborhood Wendy's.  I've been coming to this Wendy's since I was a college student at Georgia Tech.  In those days, the 99¢ value menu existed.  These days, it's the ""Right Price Right Size Value Menu,"" a menu Wendy's has been rolling out to its restaurants nationwide in 2013.  While I'm disappointed, I can't blame them.  Costs increase.  Less than half of the original 99¢ menu items are still available for 99¢.  Examples of items I typically order that used to be 99¢:

Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger - now $1.59
Double Stack - now $1.79
Caesar or Garden Side Salad - now $1.39
Small Chili - now $1.49

Regardless of the price increases, the value menu is still dirt cheap.  You can stuff yourself silly for just about $5.00 with a meal that includes vegetables, carbs, protein, and a sweet dessert.  Plus, 99¢ items still exist, such as the Jr. Cheeseburger, Crispy Chicken Sandwich, 4-piece Chicken Nuggets, and a ""Value"" sized Natural-Cut Fries, soft drink, and Frosty.

When it comes to fast food, I prefer Chick-fil-A and McDonald's because, to me, they taste better.  Wendy's isn't far behind, though.  They've stepped their game up in the French fry department.  I also think their nuggets and side salads (using mixed greens) are underrated.  I like that you can get their nuggets spicy.

Also, I love the Vanilla Frosty.  So much better than the chocolate, IMO.

This Wendy's location underwent a renovation within the past few years, so it has a relatively fresh and updated look.  The inside is much nicer and more contemporary-looking than before and now features a Coca-Cola Freestyle touchscreen fountain drink machine.

I'm not a fan of fast food, but my little boy wanted Wendy's and this one was the closest one to where we are located.  I went with my wife, my oldest and youngest son's and I think that will easily be the worst spent $39 (yes, you read that right!) all year.  I'm like fully convinced that at the end of this year, I'll still rank it this way.

So, you may be asking yourself what in the world did I spend $39 on?  Well, $39 for 3 Baconator meals, chicken sandwiches for my son with a side of fries and Baconator fries.  With that being said, I wish I can rank zero stars due to their extremely poor customer service, non-working soda machines, non-working ice machines, Baconator fries with shredded cheese and pieces of bacon cold with each order smaller than the next.  

It took 15 minutes to get my food and I had to bring it back because of the cheap cop out serving of fries.  I went to their drink machine and it wasn't working, their ice machine wasn't working and a meal now costs $9 each!  To make things worst, the building is half-empty, are just as expensive as their neighbors Chick-fil-A and their service was completely awful.  

I will never step foot at this Wendy's and quite frankly, you shouldn't either.

864,Wendy's,1.0,"I'm not one to be picky.  I give establishments  3 chances to see if they can fulfill my demands, so that I can continue supporting them.  My recent visit to this Wendy's, in particular, really made me mad.

My first bad experience consisted of a Baconator burger that was too crispy.  It barely had any flavor or juicy sensation.  The fries were also very crispy and not soft enough.  The fruit punch beverage tasted like water too.  The employee that I brought this up to said there was nothing he could do about it.  5 minutes later, another employee came by the beverage dispensers and changed out the beverages that tasted bad.  Wait what?  You couldn't do anything, you said??

My second bad experience consisted of an employee that asked if I wanted a receipt for frosties that I ordered.  I denied.  And just as she went to get the frosties I ordered, I politely told her I changed my mind that I did want a receipt after all.   She begrudgingly printed out a copy of my order and looked at me with an impatient rage.  There was no one else in the restaurant!  Not like she had anyone else to take care of.

And finally: the thing that really turned me away was a piece of hair, I discovered as I ate half way through my spicy chicken sandwich.  Disgusting!  And that's not all.  What possibly looked to be the same employee who served me the second time, served me my sandwich via drive-thru, with negativity in her face being visibly open like she hates her job.

The double single cheeseburger is okay but I'd pass on the single as it's too much bun in relation to the patty.

Great thing with Wendy's is you can pick any side with your combo without paying extra. Caesar salads have been consistently fresh and generously sized. Their Nacho Chili cheese is surprisingly tasty.

Almost every time you go there, they make a mistake.

They will forget an item, or charge you for an additional item (which, of course, you don't end up noticing until they bring out your food, unless you check your receipt while waiting), and god forbid you have a ""special order"" (add pickles, no mayo, whatever), there is a fair chance, that they will mess that up. If you ask for something to be added, there is a 50/50 shot they will forget to add it.
If you ask for a sandwich without a certain item, there is a 50/50 shot, that they will leave that item in. And if they remember to not include that particular item, there is a good chance they will also not include other parts of the sandwich that you did want. (eg. I went there on Friday, ordered the sriracha chicken sandwich with no onions, they gave it to me with nothing but chicken and creamy sriracha. When I brought it back to have it fixed, they forgot the cheese).

I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich plus a small order of fries, and my friend got the same sandwich plus a fruit bowl - yay to them for having nutritional choices too. Their salads also looked really good. The cashier gave us some sort of pylon thing, and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to stand around there and wait for my order or what ...

I rolled up to this Chick fil A relatively hung-over. I was wearing my pathetic glasses that are missing an ear-stem. Crooked and looking haggard, you can't deny that I was obviously covered in glitter. If you were to look closely, the only thing in my passenger seat would have been a wig. So I glittered over to the cashier and handed him my card. Which embarrassingly declined.

The manager gave me a highfive through the drive-thru window the other day.  One of the employees refers to me as ""Sweet Tea"" since that's what I always get.

So yes.  It probably only deserves four but it gets the fifth because I love it that much.

Onto the food: The new spicy chicken sandwich is a thing of beauty, and way better than the competitor spicy chickens around.  It's just the right blend of hot without being overwhelming and it benefits from being eaten plain, or just with mayo.  For some reason the cheese, lettuce and tomato only serve to mess with the flavor.

However, it's not really the lunch here that won over my heart, it was the breakfast.  Chick-fil-A has hands down the best breakfast food of any fast food chain.  The chicken biscuit is flaky and salty and sweet (if you add honey like I do) all at the same time and it's perfect.

908,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"Chick-Fil-A is really the best of the best in regards to fast food chains.  I really admire a company that puts their principles into action over profits (remaining closed on Sundays) and I really don't care what others think of it.  With that being said Chick-Fil-A couldn't stay in business without having the best chicken in the business and there's no doubt here that when it comes to chicken you're not going to find any fast food chains with better chicken.  

Yes Popeyes! chicken is totally awesome but it's also a totally different style of chicken than Chick-Fil-A.  I think the only food that could challenge them is Raising Cane's chicken.  Not only is this restaurant clean and brightly lit, with very friendly people but you will also find the place really a great place to take children as they have a huge area for them to play in.  

I typically get a spicy chicken sandwich and a side of chicken noodle soup (which is delicious) but their wraps, especially the grilled chicken wrap is great if I'm in the mood to eat a little healthier.  At many fast food restaurants the ""healthy"" food is something you suffer through when you're watching your waistline but not the wraps here, I'd order them just because they are that good.  

Their fries are really good *IF* they are just fresh made but I find once they get to room temperature they really are pretty average.  So make sure that if you get fries you get them hot and eat them while they're hot!

913,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"I think fast-food workers sometimes are unfairly maligned for their supposed surliness.  In my experience, probably 80-90% of them at least say ""sir"" and ""thank you"" and ""have a good day,"" if not with a smile, than at least in a friendly fashion.  

But Chick-fil-a takes it a step further.  I don't know if they train the employees to be super-polite, or if they just tend to hire friendly people, but it shows.  I really like how they say ""my pleasure"" instead of ""you're welcome.""  It lends a bit of Southern class to the transaction.  As far as service goes, is there another fast-food place that hires a worker specifically to take people's trays and offer refills?  I doubt it.

All of that would be moot if the food wasn't good, but it's perfect.  How they get the chicken to be so juicy and flavorful, I don't know, but it puts all other fast-food chicken sandwiches to shame (including McDonald's ""Southern-style"" sandwich, a pathetic attempt at a ripoff).  I get the regular breaded sandwich with extra pickles and dip it in buffalo sauce, and there are very few foods I'd rather eat, especially in the realm of fast food.  The waffle fries, too, are among the best fries available, with tons of potato flavor, and the shape is perfect for scooping up copious quantities of ketchup.  Chick-fil-a serves some of the best lemonade in town as well.

I did try the new spicy sandwich a couple of months ago, and while it was delicious, it left me in intestinal agony for a good 36 hours.  But my stomach is growing more and more sensitive to spicy foods as I get older, so that's just me... hopefully your experience will be better.

If I had to find something to complain about, it's that they offer ketchup only by the packet.  If you use as much ketchup as I do on your fries, every meal here will begin with three or four minutes of opening and squeezing.

921,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"Customer service A+

New restaurants are constantly popping up all over the Columbus area. There are also many places that have been here for a long time but seem to take that for granted, but not Chick-fil-A!

Chick-fil-A started in 1946 as the Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, Georgia.  In 1961 the name was changed to Chick-fil-A.  The first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta, GA.

Every Chick-fil-A that I have ever been to treats the customers with care, and truly appreciates that you are eating at their restaurant.  This location goes above and beyond to make sure that you have a fantastic experience.  

I eat out a lot and find that most places seem to care but not really.  Today I had the best experience ever and I wanted to share it with everybody.

We arrived a few minutes before noon on Tuesday April 2, 2019.  The line for the drive thru was wrapped around the building, which is normal for this location.  The parking lot was nearly full, but we found a place to park.  As we entered the building a worker was wiping the windows down and greeted us with a genuine hello and a smile.  The line to place an order was 3 rows deep which seems like it would take forever to get through the line, but they have about 5 registers open and the line moves really fast.

Our order taker was friendly, cheerful and seemed to really care about being there and helping us with our order.  He answered all of our questions and was very helpful with taking our order.  The order process was flawless!  I appreciated that they weren't stingy with the dipping sauces and let us choose several different kinds.

We headed toward the dining room to find a table and and as we were sitting down two employees came over to assist.

One brought over a high chair and removed the regular chair and the the other rolled out the red carpet for us.  She put a disposable placement down along with Purell wipes for the little one and then she brought us napkins, plastic ware, and ketchup.

We were totally impressed with the level of service today.

We didn't even have to go back up for drink refills as somebody came by later to refill our drinks and get a to-go back for some leftovers.

Order:
Kids meal - 4 piece nuggets, fruit and apple juice.
Cobb Salad with spicy chicken.
Spicy chicken sandwich with fries & drink.

Everything was fresh, and tasted great.

930,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"This is a solid Chick-fil-A! It's in a convenient location, and the employees are friendly. The drive-thru does take a fairly long time.

You also get a free chocolate chip cookie if you check-in on Yelp! I had never ordered a cookie from a Chick-fil-A before and I was very pleasantly surprised. It was large and tasty. I also enjoy the Spicy chicken sandwich and the grilled chicken nuggets. The nuggets are low calorie and high in protein, so I consider the nuggets an almost healthy snack option. 

Also, the lemonade here, like at all other Chick-fil-A's, is delicious. However, I noticed a tendency to put too much ice in the lemonades. I order the lemonade with ""no ice"" and I end up getting a ton more. The lemonade is still cold, too.

934,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"Chick-fil-A is an all around great fast food chain, and definitely my go-to for a sandwich and fries. They have crispy fried chicken sandwiches and nuggets. They also have grilled chicken sandwiches and grilled nuggets which have fewer carbs and calories. The best side is of course the waffle fries, they're always crisp and hot, with the perfect amount of sea salt. They also have fruit and a kale ""superfood"" side as well. Just be careful as the ""superfood"" side unfortunately has a good amount of sugar due to the dressing.

In addition to sandwiches and fries Chick-fil-A has fantastic salads. They could beef up the fresh toppings a bit but the lettuce is always fresh and they have a nice assortment of dressings. They also have breakfast and dessert. I love their frozen coffee, it's the perfect combination of a sugar fix and a pick me up.

This Chick-fil-A in particular is just as good as all the others. For quite some time they struggled to efficiently handle the large crowds that gather for lunch every day. They've recently instituted the best practices followed by other Chick-fil-A's including attendant led ordering in the drive thru and crowd control in the dining room. These have helped quite lot. The employees here are as friendly as any of the Chick-fil-A's I've been to. 

For quite some time they've had a special check in offer on yelp - a free Chocolate Chunk Cookie! Hello! These cookies are actually really hearty and good, soft, with large chunks of chocolate. I would say they're far better than what I would expect from a fast food restaurant. If that's not enough to get you to come in I don't know what is. Bonus - I've used the check in offer more than once. ;-)

I would recommend downloading the Chick-fil-A One app because they often give away freebies in the app, no purchases necessary. The calendar card that is sold once a year around the holidays is also a great value and a good gift idea. It's 12 months worth of free items, one for each month, and typically costs about $7.00. So for the price of a meal you get 12 free things.

That doesn't necessarily speak for all the other Chick-fil-A locations that I didn't visit, but this review isn't about them either.

To start with, this place is pretty overpriced for fast food. I got a deluxe sandwich, a fruit cup, and an iced tea totaling more than ten dollars. It's a bit unreasonable. And the sandwich itself is really nothing special; it just consists of chicken, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. The fruit cup had sliced strawberries, apples, oranges, and grapes that were probably kept in a refrigerator for a while and weren't fresh. And the large cup of iced tea was just that; there's no reason it should have cost $1.79! If the food were a little better and the prices were lower, then I might like this place more.

That being said, Chick-fil-A is something I look forward to at times when I travel. Needless to say this visit was painfully disappointing. At 1:30 in the afternoon my daughter and I chose to wait in a very long line with the mindset that at least our food would be hot (wrong). There were 4 cashiers working so we thought that possibly the line would move quickly and orders would be correct (wrong). When I received my chicken sandwich the bun was so hard I had to throw away the bottom half because it was literally inedible. I was actually glad I removed the bun because it gave me a chance to examine the rest of the sandwich... the lettuce was so brown it was almost black, I had to look twice to make sure I didn't see any slime. The tomatoes were not ripe at all - they were mostly yellow. And the cheese was so hard and stuck to the other bun I had to peel it off. The only thing that was good was the chicken itself. I basically ate the chicken and the pickle. The waffle fries were surprisingly cold - I was surprised at this due to the speed at which the food was coming out.

Give it up to the Mormons to develop such a juicy piece of chicken, even in spicy crispy form.  I can understand why they needed Sunday off, because well, you need time to butter those chicken breasts. I've had the best relationships with Mormons, maybe it's a Hill Cumorah thing OR maybe it's because I am a chicken...who knows?

The Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich- what a signature sandwich to get inducted into the family for the first time.  It was beautifully crisped, and lightly buttered on top.  It came with lett, and tom, and had just the right amount of kick.  Yelp! Tip- the Sandwiches DO NOT come with dressing for the most part.  Request the Chick-Fil-A sauce for the REG GRILLED/FRIED sandwiches.

The Chick-Fil-A Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich- this is definitely my go to sandwich for grilled chicken.  I love the signature honey roasted bbq sauce, but still not my favorite sauce overall.  The lemon grilled chicken here is so juicy, it's incredible that its fast food.  This sandwich is a BONUS for the Apple-wood smoked bacon--that was the REAL stuff, cause no-one likes a faker.  The brioche bun was the BEST to hold the entire sandwich together.

WAFFLE POTATO FRIES- this is my winner for BEST side you can get at a ""fast food"" establishment.  Their perfectly crispy while still maintaining those squishy parts, like a good bum bum.  Always hard to order a large cause they sell out FAST.  Get these with the Sweet N Spicy Sriracha Sauce- THE BEST SAUCE HERE.  This sauce I will actually replace on ALL my sandwiches from now on, a delicious blend of chili peppers for a spicy twist. Unfortunately, it's one of the only sauces you can't get in bulk.  Get the POLYNESIAN SAUCE in the bulk bottle, the CHICK-FIL-A sauce goes bad FAST in bulk bottle.

BEVERAGE- i am making a note that my Dr. Pepper tasted so real, that the regular beverages are still ABOVE most fast food establishments.

1018,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"Please be warned that this review is 40% about the restaurant and 60% of the corporation, concept and founder of Chick Fil-A. 

I had never eaten at a Chick Fil-A before 3 months ago.   (Hey, I'm from California.)  I was browsing at Half-priced books and saw the autobiography of Truett Cathy (Founder of the enterprise) in the bargain bin and I picked it up, knowing only that it was a succesful business and his picture seemed quite likable.   I vaguely recalled there was a Christian angle and despite being fairly ferociously anti-organized religion and particularly anti- Southern-Baptist-Conservative-hatemonger-Republican-crook and scallywag machine, I was still interested.   I like a good rags to riches story.  I was open-minded.  

This sounds dorky, but, seriously I could not put the freakin' book down.  Truett Cathey is a marvelous human being.    He is all about charity and good works, and happy people and feeding the hungry and helping poor orphans and ohmygawd, I was impressed.   This is a REALLY GOOD man.   (not at all like the christians we hear about, if you know what i mean).   When he talks about god, its with a pure joy and celebration -- y'know -- the whole ""god is love thing"".   The whole vengeful nasty racist homophobic god is nowhere in sight.  

Anyway, this guy has a tremendous rags to riches story that might just leave you teary at times.  I was inspired.  If you know anything about how franchises typically work, this one will blow you away because the business model is NOTHING like any other franchise.  Actually, its not technically a franchise. 

Now to the food.  OK, I'm inspired by the book so I have to try a sandwich.   I did.  Its a chicken sandwich.  It didn't dance and sing.   Its was pretty good for fast food and I did like the diet lemonade.  I had a salad later on that was bland but decent.    The people who work at Chick Fil A  are freakishly nice and friendly.   If you read the book, it all makes sense.   Is it going to make me run out and give up my heathen multitheastic ways?  No.  But it does give me hope that there are really truly good people in this world who are inspiring.

1027,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"This was a happy weekend, a very happy weekend.

We woke up bright and early on Saturday and finished our morning errands. Then around lunch time the kids, Mrs. T., and I decided we wanted a casual lunch. Normally we try to adventure out into the crazy ""mom and pop"" places here in Austin, but it seems a lot of these places can put a strain on the wallet!

It just so happens we were all in our local electronic's store, Fry's, when we got our T.-family hunger pains. We asked one of the gentlemen that worked there where we could get something local and cheap. Without hesitation he said, ""Chic-Fil-A."" I was perplexed, Chic-Fil-A...that sound expensive or like a French clothing line. I asked Mrs. T. as she owns some French dresses, but she was equally confused. I told him that we weren't looking for a fancy restaurant, but he said it was casual (which is exactly what we were looking for) and kid friendly (which was a bonus).

So we went down the street on the good ol' Missouri-Pacific and found ourselves at Chic-Fil-A.

By George! I'm hooked! The owner, Mark Ortega, greeted us as we walked in. They are pretty relaxed there as they let you sit where you want! No hostesses bossing you around, imagine that! Turns out in order to save you money, you order at the front. I've seen this practice in other small Mom and Pops I've been to (and I'm glad its catching on). 

The kids had the small chicken morsels, Mrs. T. had the grilled sandwich, and I had the ""original."" All I have to say is that they are divine. The chicken must be marinated in some secret locally-made marinade, and the breading must have been from Heaven.

Here's an interesting fact: I read that this little casual/local eatery invented the chicken sandwich! Whoa!! Mark that as another awesome invention to come out of Austin.

But we will get to that) Drove away and started drinking the coffee and it was terrible. I called them right away to inform them that the syrup might be bad so they should check it, spoke with the manager and she wrote me down for a free coffee my next visit.
Flash forward to today. Picked my sister up from work and came across the street for lunch. Ordered the mystery offer (in which the employee validate once again that it was the BBQ chicken sandwich), the large iced coffee, and a large fry. Came to the window, gave the lady my calendar card, my receipt from my last purchase to get my coffee, and then my debit card. She told me the total was $7.55 and she swiped my card. She saw my confusion and said ""The mystery offer is an ice cream cone"". Really? I told her no it's not and refused to take my bag, the guy validated while I was at the board and last week while I was here. The manager came over and says ""I'm sorry, but it has changed"". She didn't even try to sound helpful or ""sorry"" in any kind of way. I told her she can go ahead and take that sandwich off and she gave me a receipt for the money back on the card. 
As a manger, you would think that you would properly communicate with the rest of your employees that there has been a change in the mystery offer; if you have the order already in, the sandwich already in the bag and being handed over, you should honor it.

1059,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"A funny thing happened on the way to a chicken sandwich...

I'll admit.  I've avoided the Braker and Research location of Chick-Fil-A for years even though I work in the area.  The intersection backs up every direction, and that whole parking lot LOOKS like a hot mess.  But a coworker the other day suggested picking up at drive thru, and since they were driving, who was I to complain?

Now they've turned the whole parking lot into a Disneyland line.  They have multiple car lines, going every which direction, multiple staff standing in the lot taking orders (and non-cash payments) electronically, many signs trying to bring organization to the chaos.  I was expecting to see one of them say ""From this point on, your wait for waffle fries is 45 minutes"", and was looking for the FastPass machine. 

But the result was shockingly fast drive thru service.

Fast forward two weeks, and an out-of-town coworker had a craving for the old #1, so we decided to eat in.  Even in the noon hour, we easily found a parking spot and walked in.  The place was full, but every register was open.  No wait in line, and then we get a NUMBER for our table.  Delivered to your table fast food?  And then being asked if we had everything we needed, instead of just dumping it off?  Shut the front door!

A subsequent staffer asking if ""everything was OK"" caught us off guard.  Two more stops offering (and happily getting us) drink refills was shocking.  Table clearing, but not in a way that made it seem like they wanted us to leave, caught us off guard.  

Then the kicker.  When asked if we needed ""anything else"", my friend coyly mentioned wanting a ""Banana Pudding Shake"".  The helpful staffer said ""What size to you want?  The Small is $2.78.""  (I might not have the number right, but he did)  So he took the $3, and came back in a few minutes with my friend's shake and the change.

Amazing.  At a fast food place.

I'm a sucker for the regular fried chicken sandwich.  Sure, I'll eat the grilled when I want to be ""good"" (with waffle fries, of course), but the #1 is their bread and butter.  (btw, they butter their sandwich bread)

If your review says ""I had the salad and a fruit cup, and have no idea what everyone is going on about..."", then  you're doing it wrong.

If you give one star because they are closed Sunday, and don't do the same for any other place that might be closed on a Monday, then you're just being a douche.

I eat here a lot because it's about 15 minutes away from where I work. I usually get lunch to-go (reasonably fast considering the amount of cars in the drive-thru) and eat at my desk in the office. One time, I ordered a regular chicken sandwich (the #1) on a really busy day and realized when I got back to the office that I received something healthy. It was a grilled chicken sandwich with wheat bread and veggies.

I was disappointed because I like my fried food. A coworker who also ordered from Chick-Fil-A called to complain that our order was wrong.

THIS IS THE INCREDIBLE PART.

The owner of the restaurant answered and apologized. Since we couldn't return to the restaurant to exchange the order (I only have so long for my lunch break) he DELIVERED a new chicken sandwich to my work, still warm.

Let me repeat that. THE CHICK-FIL-A RESTAURANT OWNER DELIVERED A HOT CHICKEN SANDWICH TO MY OFFICE AT WORK.

1092,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"I came to the Clackamas location of Chick-fil-A on a weekday afternoon after the lunch rush.  Judging by the insane lines I had always seen wrapped around this popular dining destination, it was a smart move.  

The entire establishment was spotlessly clean, from the glass to the parking lot to the floors and restrooms to the seating and tables.  CLEAN.  And this not more than an hour after the lunch rush.  After every diner left their table, an attendant systematically wiped down their seats and dining surfaces with a mild chlorine solution that was still strong enough for me to smell from the booth across the aisle.  The courteous staff were all friendly and actually smiled and asked how they could assist us throughout the time we were there, but not intrusively so.  

We ordered the signature chicken sandwiches and fries with milkshakes and a couple of dipping sauces (they have many).  My fellow diner ordered her sandwich without a bun wrapped in lettuce.  The sandwiches were enclosed in a little skirt that caught all of the stray juices--a detail which made a big difference.  The food was fresh, hot and of an extremely high quality that did not taste like fast food.  I normally avoid chicken because it is nearly always overcooked, overseasoned or even rancid.  This over-the-top wonderfully juicy chicken was perfectly prepared with a delicately fresh flavor.  The sealed packages of tasty dipping sauces only enhanced the meal--they would make the food of several Chick-fil-A competitors much more palatable if I'd had the presence of mind to save some for later.  There was a thoughtfully provided basket where you could drop off any unused dipping sauces.  The milkshakes were also extremely good and definitely made of real ice cream--very rich and flavorful.  

The dining area was well designed with translucent glass panels around the booths to separate you from your diners on the other side--an attractively efficient use of space that kept the well-lit area from feeling too small or dark.  I took the time to thank one of the staff who was cleaning across from me--I was that impressed with the whole operation--and I filled out a glowing comment card.

1104,Chick-fil-A,1.0,"What was a stop at a higher and fast food ""restaurant ""ended up being a very disappointing visit.

First I'll start with the food, I think is pretty tasty and like I said on the higher end of fast food however it is a bit overpriced for the quantity you get. I will equate it to Bergerville in terms of overall bang for your buck as far as quantity goes, but I would take Bergerville over Chick-fil-A nine out of 10 times. We spent 12 to 13 bucks and had a couple of teeny chicken strips and a rather small chicken sandwich and a small portion of french fries and a couple of drinks.

Onto the service, which is what gets this location the rating that it has. I've been here probably four times and I would say two of those times I had exceptional service I would give it 4 of 5 stars.  The other two times were polar opposite visits then the previously mentioned ones. This last one on Wednesday the 25th takes the cake.

I'm out the front Counter getting ready to place an order when the staff at the drive-through which is right next to front counter crank up the radio. The songs are playing is a hip hop song about cocaine and how the singer loves cocaine, will go loco and kill someone and several times in the song uses some very colorful language.  ""F"" the popo and dropping the N word as well.

No I have no problem with music being verbally charged like that, I listened to more than my share of it when I was younger too. I was always respectful enough though not the subject other people's kids to hearing derogatory racial slurs or cussing, that just is uncalled for especially at a place of business such as this.  Chick-fil-A has a reputation of being very family orientated and conscientious of everybody's beliefs and feelings, however the staff do not act in such a manner as was displayed on this evening.

I was in line with a nine-year-old when this music comes on and the girls in the drive-through start dancing around and twerking, and the kid with me has this look on his face like he can't believe what he's hearing or seeing.  He is not overly sheltered, but I don't play this kind of music for him to hear.

I had asked the girl who is ringing us up to have them turn it down they should be playing that in this establishment and we look out in the dining room and there's other families out there that are staring up at the counter with a looks of disgust at what they are hearing.  Ignoring us really, she said oh I'm sorry I know and then proceeded to finish our transaction.

As soon as she was done she turned around to walk the opposite direction to go clean tables. Didn't say a word to the staff back there having a good all-time and shaking booties to this very inappropriate song for that place and time.

I walked by the staff who rang us up as we were walking to the table with our food and said to her - can you have the manager come talk to me please, to which she replied sure.

We're about halfway through the meal and I could see the manager talking to her and the other staff before coming over to talk to me and she walks up saying I heard you wanted to talk to me? I expressed to her what had happened and how inappropriate that is for a family establishment and she said in a condescending way oh I understand they lost their music privileges now. I was outside and I didn't know.  It was plainly obvious that she just didn't really care, and she really is pretty close the same age as the other staff having a party while they work in the drive-through so that doesn't surprise me.

Well, the big crowds are gone now, so I finally went to check them out.  My first impression was that their seating area is quite spacious for a fast food place. . .well, I suppose it needs to be large to handle the kind of crowds they got.  I know people love the chicken sandwiches there because of their good quality and the chicken is cooked fresh when it's ordered.  Anyway, NOW I realize that I should have ordered some type of regular sandwich on a bun instead of a wrap because the chicken on a sandwich would have been freshly cooked and hot.  I was (unwittingly) trying to limit my carbs and ordered the less ""bulky"" grilled chicken wrap.  I was disappointed that the chicken in my wrap was cold, so obviously it wasn't freshly grilled.

1117,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"We were finally able to get in to this place after the hype of it started slowly dying. We've heard good of this place; delicious, juicy sandwiches, crisp fries, etc. Ordered some kid's meals and combos.

...wasn't really thrilled...

First off, the sandwich was sub par. Not juicy as everyone has told me. It was borderline dry. No, it wasn't as busy (only a few people in ordering at the time, 3 cars in queue at the drive thru), so it had to be sauced more than I'd like. 

The kid's chicken nuggets were highly disappointing. We were expecting at least some decent cut of chicken, but ended up with portions equivalent to that of the little nibblets that you get at the end of a bag of frozen chicken thighs. 

The only thing we really enjoyed was the waffle fries. I'm fact, that was one of the redeeming qualities that the restaurant had.

The other thing was the customer service. They were nice and refilled our drinks while we sat and watched the kids play in the little play area. Really courteous and one of the reasons why this place didn't get a lower rating. 

Because of the hype of this place, trying to find parking in the already rediculously small parking lot makes it a waiting game for a spot or a impromptu hike from adjoining parking areas. We were going to an adjoining restaurant to here, only to find myself circling the 2 parking lots (one proper the other an annex) for several minutes (the place we were going to wasn't busy,  majority of the crowd as at Chic)

I ordered our spicy chicken sandwiches and the famous waffles fries and when the cashier asked what kind of sauce would you like? ah the memories, I said can you give me one of each. 

As I bite in to my spicy chicken sandwich, which was so crispy, so fresh and cooked just right. No unprocessed meat at all, Tasted so good and so amazing, just as I remembered.
 Dipping my waffle fries and trying out all the different sauces, Yums!! I loved the waffle fries, so crispy and the sauce accompanied it so well.

1134,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"Based on the traffic jam out front, a line of cars on both sides of the street waiting to turn into the parking lot at 3:00 on a Saturday, clearly I'm the ""odd gal out"" with my take on Chick-fil-A. Could be that I'm not into fast food chains, preferring awesomeness from a food cart any day. And since food carts are everywhere in Portland, no need for the chains. 

After trying the chicken nuggets and mac & cheese at the Beaverton location and being far from satisfied, I decided to give Chick-fil-A another try based on the encouragement of Yelp friends. Plus, full disclosure, I took the phone survey on the receipt and they rewarded me with a free chicken sandwich!

Refusing to wait in that traffic jam to go through the drive thru for mediocre food, I parked and walked in. Far better choice. Was immediately greeted and was first in line to order.  Note to people, get out of the car and walk in! This time they offered me sauce, which is needed for the chicken, and I selected the ranch. They handed me a beeper thing and within minutes my sandwich arrived. I was extremely impressed with the level of customer service they provide. Had no idea they brought the food to your table; I assumed like all fast food chains, you wait to retrieve your tray of food at the counter. 

There was plenty of seating inside. High tops, booths, tables - all with a small vase of flowers. The place was clean, the stations where you get napkins and condiments was stocked and clean. At 3:00, it looked like prime dinner hour.  Clearly people love Chic-fil-A!

Opened my tin foil pac and was surprised by how small the sandwich was for the price, not my free price but what one would typically pay. And other than two tiny pickle slices, thin slices, there was nothing. No lettuce, no tomato. Hmmm. I put the ranch dressing on the spicy chicken (last time I had regular which had no flavor) and went for it. It was OK. Not bad, not great.  Satisfied my hunger since I had left the house at 8am, swam an hour at the gym, then ran errands at 5+ stores. But it was nothing I now crave and would ever decide I wanted to have for lunch. But as far as fast food chains go, it was decent. 

I just think I'm not the demographic. If I had kids and needed a quick meal, I could see this being a viable option. But I go to McDonalds maybe 3-4 times a year when I am craving a sausage and cheese muffin, and that's literally it for me and fast food joints. I also don't do Olive Garden (it's so not good Italian food), Applebee's or any of the mid tier food chains.

1135,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"What a ridiculous amount of time to spend waiting for a McChicken.

I have been hearing people talk up the virtues of this place for a very long time and when it was finally set to come to the Pacific Northwest, I made note of it.  Then, as a mid-ride treat to my family and I  (I was riding my bicycle) we decided to stop in and have a quick lunch before getting back on the road.  There was a line out the door.

And around the parking lot.

And in the spot where you wait for food.

Honestly, I was blown away.  I realize that a new place like this is going to create a sort of cult around it and people are going to be intrigued, but the customer service, to start, was mishandled.  I arrived about 10 minutes before they stopped serving breakfast.  I didn't get to the front of the line until 30 minutes after they stopped.  there was no apology, nobody pre-emptively taking orders (like they were doing in the drive through), it was just wait there for your chance to order and then get shuffled off to the side so you could then wait for your order.  There was nothing from the cashier apologizing for my delay or giving me even a time estimate on how long my food would take.  No, after I paid for my two sandwiches and chicken strips, I had to wait another ten minutes to get my food.  Invariably, once I did get it-it was just warm.

I was there for  45 minutes before I got to eat food that wasn't even hot.  Perhaps the flavor would have been better had I been eating hot food, but what I ended up having is a overpriced chicken sandwich that I wouldn't be able to tell it was different from McDonalds/Wendy's/BK.  Yes, I could have notified them that my food was not hot and I would prefer something hot, but I was famished at this point and I couldn't see waiting another 10 minutes to make my ""fast food"" experience go even longer.    The only reason my review is not a single star is the place was well seated, clean and had a nice little play area for the kids (very little).  The outdoor seating was nice as well, though some bike parking wouldn't have been a bad idea.

Seriously, skip this place-you aren't missing out on anything.",  ridiculous amount time spend wait McChicken hear people talk virtue place long time finally set come Pacific Northwest make note mid ride treat family rid bicycle decide stop quick lunch get back road line door around parking lot spot wait food Honestly blow away realize new place like go create sort cult around people go intrigue customer service start mishandle arrive minute stop serve breakfast get front line minute stop apology nobody pre emptively take order like drive wait chance order get shuffle side could wait order nothing cashier apologize delay give even time estimate long food would take pay two sandwich chicken strip wait another ten minute get food Invariably get warm minute get eat food even hot Perhaps flavor would good eat hot food end overpriced chicken sandwich able tell different McDonalds Wendy BK Yes could notify food hot would prefer something hot famish point see wait another minute make fast food experience go even longer reason review single star place well seat clean nice little play area kid little outdoor seating nice well though bike park bad idea Seriously skip place miss anything,0.0870092551127034,Positive
1136,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"Compared to the Hillsboro location, this place is seriously lacking in speed.  The design and location of this restaurant is seriously awful. 

They should've designed two Full drive-through lanes for the continuous large amount of patrons who frequent this location.  And the bad part is... The population is surely to grow. 

One of the ordering stations in the drive-through was blocked off and closed on a Saturday night?     

I was in the drive-through, slow slow slow. The drive-through did not move for eight minutes and that is a very long time for a fast food restaurant.  

I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries. They were both delicious and therefore the reason I have given them two stars today instead of one.

1138,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I'm so glad to have Chick Fil A back in Clackamas. I sure wish they had more parking, but that's the only down-side I can think of to this place. 

The service is fantastic, super friendly and fast- especially considering they just opened. They were very well organized. It was crowded but very clean inside and out. 

The food was very good, pricey for fast food, but higher quality too.

The spicy chicken sandwich is my favorite but I can't eat it every day. It's not too spicy for an adult but for a child or anyone who doesn't like a little kick, it gets a little too hot towards the end. 

The regular chicken sandwich is mild and not too salty or bready. Both taste best fresh, if you let them sit, the bun will get a bit greasy (you know, like fast food?)  

The sandwiches come with pickle but not with lettuce or any condiments like mustard or mayo. They have a fry sauce called Chick Fil A sauce that is good to add onto the sandwiches and for dipping the fries in. 

I always loved the regular sandwiches but my new favorite is the wrap. I haven't tried all of the sauces and dressings yet because there are so many of them but so far  my favorite is the ranch. I think it's called garlic ranch but it doesn't have an overpowering garlic flavor. I like the italian too. 

The waffle fries are good, I like to add some extra salt to them. They have regular and diet fresh lemonade, along with soda and milkshakes.

But the macaroni and cheese was legit 11/10.  I am so picky about Mac and cheese.  I don't even like classic kraft.  I'm more of a beechers fan.  I was not expecting this dish to be as good as it is.  I will return many times for this alone.

1140,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I usually don't write reviews on the same day as having frequented an establishment.  The timing can be all over the map.  However, today, a staple of Southern Americana came (back) to the Portland metro area.  Chick-fil-A opened a new store in Clackamas and, while the last one was in the food court at Clackamas Town Center when there was an ice skating rink there, this one occupies the site across the street where Chevy's Mexican Restaurant used to be.  

The store is a nice one and, with its brickwork and trellises, looks like it could fit in quite well in the burbs of its hometown Atlanta.  Incidentally, College Park, GA is really its hometown.  (College Park is where you may very well be picking up your rental car, parking your car on a long-term basis, or getting some ""shut eye"" if using ATL airport).  The interior is large and airy, with ample space around the counter area and with a vast seating area.  The interior is also slightly rustic, harkening minimally to Cracker Barrel, another native of the South.  Maybe they're ""kissin' cousins.""  Let's not go there.

Moving onto the food, it's boilerplate Chick-fil-A and it has seemingly remained unchanged. That's a good thing.  Mostly, it's about the chicken sandwiches, which come in different forms.  For healthier fare, I prefer the grilled version, which also costs a little more.  Then, I had to sabotage its healthiness by ordering it ""club"" style, which includes Colby cheese and bacon.  The waffle cut fries have a good, lighter than usual ""potato-y"" taste and differ from those of Carl's Jr., which I also find to be good.  True to their Atlanta area roots, they feature Coca Cola products.  Thankfully, they do carry Cherry Coke, which I like, and had mixed with Coke Zero.  With all that said, the chicken patty in my burger was tender and flavorful, thus almost perfect.

The employees taking the orders and attending to the seating area were very polite, but then I find that employees further out in Clackamas, Washington, and Clark Counties tend to be more polite in fast food locales.  I'm withholding the 5th star because, while it's not ""as good as it gets"" in the realm of fast food, I'm definitely a fan, having eaten at the Chick-fil-A in Peachtree Center in downtown Atlanta some 2 or 3 times a week when I ""rode the rails"" (read MARTA) there.  The other thing is that, for this very typical trio, it's priced about a third of the way up between regular fast food and a chain operated ""fern bar,"" but then Chick-fil-A is better than most fast food.

To commemorate Chick-fil-A's arrival to Clackamas, I came up with a brief jingle for the occasion.  Here it is:

Southern folks often greet others with a twangy ""hey""
But I say, ""Hey, today is a fine day,
'Clacka-fornia' got a brand spankin' new Chick-fil-A,
And you can see it from Clackamas Town Center across the way""",  usually write review day frequent establishment timing map However today staple Southern Americana come back Portland metro area Chick fil open new store Clackamas last one food court Clackamas Town Center ice skate rink one occupy site across street Chevy Mexican Restaurant use store nice one brickwork trellis look like could fit quite well burbs hometown Atlanta Incidentally College Park GA really hometown College Park may well pick rental car park car long term basis get shut eye use ATL airport interior large airy ample space around counter area vast seating area interior also slightly rustic harken minimally Cracker Barrel another native South Maybe kissin cousin Let go Moving onto food boilerplate Chick fil seemingly remain unchanged good thing Mostly chicken sandwich come different form healthy fare prefer grill version also cost little sabotage healthiness order club style include Colby cheese bacon waffle cut fry good lighter usual potato taste differ Carl Jr also find good True Atlanta area root feature Coca Cola product Thankfully carry Cherry Coke like mix Coke Zero say chicken patty burger tender flavorful thus almost perfect employee take order attend seat area polite find employee Clackamas Washington Clark Counties tend polite fast food locale withhold th star good get realm fast food definitely fan eat Chick fil Peachtree Center downtown Atlanta time week ride rail read MARTA thing typical trio price third way regular fast food chain operate fern bar Chick fil good fast food commemorate Chick fil arrival Clackamas come brief jingle occasion Southern folk often greet others twangy hey say Hey today fine day Clacka fornia get brand spankin new Chick fil see Clackamas Town Center across way,0.1240632515632516,Positive

While Taco Bell simply suggests its customers ""think outside the bun"", Chick-Fil-A takes it one step further, using a grammatically challenged cow who encourages you to ""eat more chikin"" in an attempt to save his bovine ass.

I just don't get the Chick-fil-a thing. People here have a love for it that borders on obsession, and I just think it's kind of..... ick. 

Ick-fil-a.  Granted, their ""lightly breaded"" (aka fried) chicken sandwiches that they ""invented"" are much better than similar sandwiches elsewhere, I just think the healthier options for those of us in need of a quick bite without the potential for a minor heart attack need a few healthy options on the menu that are at least semi-satisfying. The grilled chicken strips on the salads resemble the stuff you'd find in the vacuum-packed pouches of pre-seasoned chicken strips in Kroger's refrigerated section. The grilled chicken breast on the sandwich is also weak. The BBQ and the honey mustard dipping sauces are just not good. Ick, ick, ick.

The 1,000 calories milkshakes also frighten me, and I worry about the health of my loved ones that drink them fairly often. The chicken biscuits, though I'm sure they're tasty since my brother ate one every morning on his way to high school, do not seem like such a great way to start the day off. Ick.

The one recent memory I have of Chick-fil-a that prompted me to write this pointless review of an extremely popular, much loved chain involved some nugget trays I had catered for a middle school afterschool event. I was designated the official server, and I slapped on some plastic gloves and started heaping the nuggets on the trays of the very eager, hungry students. Anyways, I went through FIVE pairs of gloves for just two nugget trays because the grease seeped through them and began dripping down past my wrists. When everything was done, I washed my hands with a buttload of soap and still couldn't get the shiny, oily feeling off my hands. ICK!

The 2 stars are definitely for the reliable catering and delivery services I've utilized at least 10 times for work (my boss is the biggest Chick-fil-a fan I know), and they're also for the incredible Diet Lemonade and fruits cups available in assorted sizes (with a good selection of fruit in them, too). Their marketing strategies and the Chick-fil-a cows are definitely damn cool. I mean, everyone I know loves this place, so I know there's something to it (my middle school students seriously ate every crumb off the trays). Old college friends of mine that visit from the north always want to try it, and I just sigh. 

I just want some more tasty, lower-calorie, healthy options, Chick-fil-a... I know I'm crazy and shouldn't even consider fast food given my disgust of fried food, but I just want to be part of the popular crowd, dammit!",  Disclaimer review pertain Chick fil franchise rather specific location since location lucky recipient ramblings Also hater fast food thing fry take consideration read anything get Chick fil thing People love border obsession think kind ick Ick fil Granted lightly bread aka fry chicken sandwich invent much good similar sandwich elsewhere think healthier option us need quick bite without potential minor heart attack need healthy option menu least semi satisfy grill chicken strip salad resemble stuff find vacuum pack pouch pre season chicken strip Kroger refrigerate section grill chicken breast sandwich also weak BBQ honey mustard dipping sauce good Ick ick ick calorie milkshake also frighten worry health loved one drink fairly often chicken biscuit though sure tasty since brother ate one every morning way high school seem like great way start day Ick one recent memory Chick fil prompt write pointless review extremely popular much love chain involve nugget tray cater middle school afterschool event designate official server slap plastic glove start heap nugget tray eager hungry student Anyways go FIVE pair glove two nugget tray grease seep begin drip past wrist everything do wash hand buttload soap still get shiny oily feel hand ICK star definitely reliable catering delivery service utilized least time work bos big Chick fil fan know also incredible Diet Lemonade fruit cup available assorted size good selection fruit marketing strategy Chick fil cow definitely damn cool mean everyone know love place know something middle school student seriously eat every crumb tray Old college friend mine visit north always want try sigh want tasty low calorie healthy option Chick fil know crazy even consider fast food give disgust fried food want part popular crowd dammit,0.12870915032679742,Positive

So, I've heard tons about Chick-Fil-A, and all of the hype is well worth it.  The chicken is deliciously juicy and fried, and the original chicken sandwich that I had was simple.  I got it no pickles (I didn't get that advice, I just saw them on the menu picture...and I hate pickles - I would definitely advise no pickles), so the sandwich was a bit dry since I didn't add any mayo (got to watch the calories somewhere).  What I didn't realize was that there are apparently all of these special sauces that you can get on your chicken sandwich.  Now if someone had only told me...  I got the meal which included waffle fries which I thought were good, but the chicken sandwich definitely outshined the fries.

I like how they show calories for all the items and of course the food is just plain good.....really good. Especially the spicy chicken sandwich......really really good.

1213,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"Nothing feels better than being at home, especially when you live nearby a Chick-fil-A. I grew up with this branch since I was in middle school. Back then, I did not know what ""going out"" or ""eating out"" was like since I am more of a ""eating at home"" kind of person. I first visited Chick-fil-A with a group of friends from school. And let me tell you...I fell in love with after that first bite into their grilled chicken sandwich (with extra pickles!)..and that is still my to go sandwich (&& I rarely like to eat sandwiches or burgers)! 

Throughout the years, I feel like the quality and services of Chik-fil-A at the Ocoee branch (also including the ones located at Winter Garden, Waterford, and Kirkman) have improved so much. I used to hate going here, especially around lunch hours since it is always packed with people but with their most recent renovation, I do not find it to be a hassle anymore. The environment is clean. The staffs are friendly and very professional. The pace is quick. The foods is fresh, warm/hot and delicious. The soft serve is to die for especially during Florida's intense heatwave. I don't know about you but I surely do not have anything to complain about. 

Out of all their items on the menu, I always enjoy their grilled chicken sandwich and Cobb salad. Those two item, are by far, my favorites at Chik-fil-A! And lets not forget about their classic waffles fries and nuggets. With some Polynesian+ketchup+hot sauce combo, I am a forever happy...until I am hungry again anyway haha. 

Moreover, there was one particular moment that I will never forget. During that time, I was into the ""salad crave"" phase and I particularly like their Cobb salad description...I was hesitant to try it out at first since I did not like the cheese toppings. I asked one cashier if it is possible to get it without cheese and she answered ""no"" with a tone of feeling annoyed by my request. Personally, I do not mind and was mentally prepared to spend my time  picking out all the cheese strands but the way she replied to my question kind of threw me off. But I was whatever about it. Though that may be, luckily, another cashier came to my rescue and said ""I will take care of it...it is always possible to have your salad without cheese upon request at anytime."" She was my knight in shining amor and I am grateful to encountered such an understanding individual like her. 

In conclusion, I love Chik-fil-A! I would love it more if they open on Sundays...haha... but I get it and I respect their choice. But oh man... I hate the feeling of spontaneously craving for CFA...to the point I would literally drive there...just to realize that it is SUNDAY! Sigh.

There are many, many fast food places in Orlando but my favorite would have to be Chick-fil-A, especially the one at this location. The staff is always so friendly, the food is always to die for. I'm obsessed with this place.

The chicken mini is just a very fluffy bread coated with a little bit of honey (I believe) with a chicken nugget nestled in the middle. It is always SO good. For lunch or dinner, I've enjoyed the salads, chicken sandwiches, tenders, and nuggets. My favorite dipping sauce would be the chick-fil-a sauce, polynesion, and bbq.

1224,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I've been to this location twice in the past week and have had great experiences both times.

My visit last week was on the way home from running some errands. I stopped in to get a meal to take home, but there was some confusion and no one put my order together. After a few minutes of waiting, one of the cashiers asked what I was still waiting for. I handed her my receipt and she handed it to a manager who got to work collecting my food. As an apology for the wait, he threw in a three piece chicken strip - effectively doubling the size of my meal. 

I went in again today to claim my free Spicy Chicken Sandwich that they're testing. The cashier suggested/upsold me on a few add-ons that they're offering with the sandwich (pepper-jack cheese and lettuce/tomato). My food came out lightning quick this time, and I was off to try this supposedly ""spicy"" sandwich.

The concept of a ""spicy"" sandwich at a fast food restaurant is kind of an insane notion, and I never actually expect to get anything that I'd call ""spicy"" or ""hot"".  That said, this did have a tiny bit of kick to it - more than I would have expected. Granted, part of that may be from the pepper-jack cheese.

While I ate, employees were walking around checking on customers, and offering to get refills. I've been Chick-Fil-As before - including this location, but I've never seen them do that before. 

There was also a person in a cow costume (no clue if there's an official mascot name) walking around entertaining the kids and whatever adults were amused enough to interact with them. 

This location is super clean - kept spotless by the number of employees roaming the dining room.

Since they were testing the new sandwich, a couple of employees stopped by to ask my opinions on the sandwich and offered me a free coupon for another spicy chicken sandwich when they officially launch next week.

The only real problem with Chick-Fil-A - any and all of them, really - is that I usually only get a craving for them on Sunday. I don't know if it's my subconscious that is annoyed that they're closed on Sundays and automatically craving them because I can't have them - but it's kind of annoying.",  location twice past week great experience time visit last week way home run errand stop get meal take home confusion one put order together minute wait one cashier ask still wait hand receipt hand manager get work collect food apology wait throw three piece chicken strip effectively double size meal go today claim free Spicy Chicken Sandwich test cashier suggest upsold add ons offer sandwich pepper jack cheese lettuce tomato food come lightning quick time try supposedly spicy sandwich concept spicy sandwich fast food restaurant kind insane notion never actually expect get anything call spicy hot say tiny bit kick would expect Granted part may pepper jack cheese eat employee walk around check customer offer get refill Chick Fil include location never see also person cow costume clue official mascot name walk around entertain kid whatever adult amuse enough interact location super clean keep spotless number employee roam dining room Since test new sandwich couple employee stop ask opinion sandwich offer free coupon another spicy chicken sandwich officially launch next week real problem Chick Fil really usually get craving Sunday know subconscious annoy close Sundays automatically crave kind annoy,0.047643097643097654,Positive

Once inside, we ordered and got our food rather quickly.  Crispy Spicy Chicken on their ""special"" bun that the grilled chicken usually comes on and a regular chicken sandwich with cheese without pickles for the boy!

We were hungry, so started eating immediately.  These sandwiches were pretty good, but not the best.  The cheese was half hanging out of the sandwich.  The spicy had 1 pickle on the bun and the bun was a little dry and crumbly.

The waffle fries were hot and crispy which is a plus.  That's one advantage to the craziness is the fries haven't been sitting there for a while.

1233,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"I think coming from the West Coast there is such a hype of what we don't have including Chick-fil-A. Fortunately, two Chick-fil-A locations are being built back home. I can only imagine the lines during the weeks from their grand openings.

So - what luck is it that I get to try it somewhere where it has been established for some time and the minor tweaks that come with first opening are of the past. 

Not your typical fast food chain, granted it is fast food. Food is delivered to you at your table and they're closed all day Sunday. Aside from that, I don't feel it's any different.

The good is good, not great. I enjoyed their fresh squeezed lemonade and the Chick-fil-A sauce with the sandwiches. Their waffle fries weren't crispy enough to my liking such as Carl's Jr., but all else was not lacking in flavor. My husband says their sandwiches are on par to what Wendy's has to offer.

1240,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"This is a fairly standard store.  They make the standard delicious chicken sandwiches.  All the food is good and like any good Chick-Fil-A.  This is a very busy location in the heart of the tourist district of LBV.  They try hard to keep the lines flowing, but are often overwhelmed.

*They've got heart at this location.*  They also have some management who love to think outside the fry box.  That's good and bad.  They do some whacky experiments at this location.  A lot of them are pretty silly.  A few of them work.

Just be aware that coming here doesn't always make sense.  They do this double lane drive-thru thing.  However, it's not always like that, it's not built for that, and sometimes it makes things really awful in the parking lot.  You can't actually see if it's operational, so if you choose poorly... you're DONE!  You have to go around the building again and get at the end of the line.  However, sometimes you're sitting there and the person comes around the corner with a look on their face like ""HEY DUMMY, USE THIS SPARE LANE.""  I promise you, though, if you went around there would have been no one standing there.  It's quite obnoxious and annoying.  This is a big fail in my book.  Frankly, this setup sometimes makes me choose somewhere else to eat.  It's that bad.

They have also done this weird thing where they have like 6 people pass your food down a chain-gang of employees to your car at the window.  It's something you have to experience in person.

They've had condiment people at a table in the drive-thru.  I'm not kidding.  Like a yard sale of condiments.

They've had a whole line of people each doing a tiny piece of your order like a production line... except your actual food comes from inside.  This was like one person takes the order, one person takes the money, one person hands you your condiments, one person gives you a drink, and one person gives you your food.  Then one person waves and tells you that it's their pleasure to serve you.

Whoever the idea person at this location is... is seriously whacked out.  They might be the goofiest fast food person in the city.  

All that said, I gave them 4 stars.  It's a very friendly store and I have yet to meet a bad egg.  They are kind and just smile/nod at you when you crack a little joke about the weird experiment of the day.  They know.  They also do what their management tells them to do.

1247,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"A week into my stint on the Disney College Program, I had no idea that Chick-Fil-A would be one of the (many) highlights of my stay down here in Orlando. But for those of us staying at Vista Way, the 5-minute walk down the street to this heavenly chicken joint is sheer bliss (or, depending on how you look at it, incredibly dangerous).

Honestly, I sometimes feel like I'm the only one here new to the Chick-Fil-A experience, since New England is apparently the only place in the country where Chick-Fil-A's aren't all over the place. West of 495 in Mass., there literally aren't any, so you'll have to forgive my exuberance. Where I come from, Taco Bell and Dunks are the pinnacle of fast food, and that's unfortunate, because - corny as it may sound - CFA takes your perceptions of fast food and turns them on its side.

Every employee is in high spirits. The entire store, every booth, is kept in tip-top shape (saying something, considering the traffic this place gets between thrifty Disney visitors and CP students). And the food - oh, my, the food. There's something intangible about it, but the food just seems like FOOD, rather than FAST food. The presentation is the same, but everything's just so tasty. I try to keep in shape by avoiding fried food whenever I can, so I'll admit I haven't tried anything fried yet, but the grilled chicken, whether in sandwich or wrap form, is spectacular. The waffle fries are superb, as are the healthier substitutions you can get. The side salad comes with a great selection of dressings. And honestly, what other fast food joint offers Diet Dr. Pepper, the diet beverage of champions?

And if all that didn't seal the deal, how about employees who come around offering to refill your drinks for free? How about sweet deals for the CP students, like two-for-one chicken sandwiches on Thursdays (I think) and handy coupons for incoming participants? How about the free mints on your way out? And I haven't even tried the breakfast yet. All of this, mind you, at prices comparable to the ""other guys.""

I loves me some T-Bell, don't get me wrong. But I'll never look at fast food the same way again. I don't even mind the subtle ""go to church"" message implied by their not being open on Sundays.

Their famous chicken sandwiches are made from breast meat that's super moist that comes in a foil bag which traps the heat thus making the bun nice and soft. It also comes with a couple pickles and that's it; sure it's a very simple recipe but for some reason, that's all you need for this great combintion that spells a great healthy choice for fast food. 

The waffle fries were also really fresh tasting, not stale or old like some places that don't go the extra mile to ensure the rotation always works best for the patron. 

They seemed over staffed with so many people on the floor looking to clean tables, and back of house seemed like there were a ton of people too which expains us waiting almost no time for our food. Overall a top notch run franchise; I am sure they are one of the top producers for Corporate.

The other big plus that I didn't realize was that they will bring the food to your table after you order.

The Food: On this particular day, I simply required something to ""hold me over"" until I got home. Being a grown adult, I have NO SHAME in ordering a kids meal. For me, it's just enough to do the job, which is to hold me over. Any other day, I'd get my usual Spicy Chicken Sandwich meal, but I wasn't trying to be stuffed. I ordered the 6 piece Chicken Nugget kids meal with Chick-fil-A sauce. This came with fries, a drink, and a toy (which I traded for a cup of ice cream). Of course, all the adults know the ""trade the toy for ice cream"" trick. What use do I have for a toy, when I can eat ice cream after? HELLOOOO?! 

Quick Tidbit: There are two Chick-fil-A locations in the area. This one, which is INSIDE the mall and another directly OUTSIDE the mall. This location, because it's inside the mall, is slightly higher in price. Keep that in mind when you're debating which is more beneficial for you. Either way, you'll be waiting to order.

I sent Chick-Fil-A an email about it, and they forwarded the info about it to the restaurant operator. I just got two coupons for free chicken biscuits in the mail today...they will probably not be used here because I'm scared still. But at least that is a recovery of 2 of the 3 times I could only eat the little hash browns and drink my orange juice for breakfast.

It's just weird because I've had non-breakfast food from here and there's been no problem. I'm not even sure how to describe what it is. The chicken kind of looks wet once you bite inside it and it just tastes bad. That's about all the detail I really want to go into. I seriously had to spit out a second bite if I dared to take one. 

But seriously, you see I am giving 3 stars...totally fine place any other time of day and because I just seriously love Chick-Fil-A.

1265,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I'm a huge fan of Chick-fil-A, especially their Original Chicken Sandwich, Spicy Chicken Sandwich, and waffle fries.  However, with my commitment to Yelp's ""In It to Thin It"" (IITTI) this year, one thing I decided to cut out (at least until the end of IITTI on February 24) is deep-fried foods.  This meant that I had to try some healthy ""fast food"" options.

For some reason, I'm not generally a fan of salads at fast food restaurants.  I like mixed greens salads, and fast food places usually serve only romaine/iceberg lettuce salads.  So the last two times I picked up a quick meal through this Chick-fil-A's drive-thru, I chose items I normally would never order here.

* Chargrilled Chicken Cool Wrap (410 calories) - Per the online menu description, this consists of ""Slices of grilled chicken breast nestled in a fresh bed of Green Leaf lettuce with shredded red cabbage, and carrots, tomato slices and a subtle blend of Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses tightly rolled in multigrain flat bread. Served with choice of dressing.""  I chose the Light Italian dressing (25 calories).  Since I had never seen anyone order this, I had no idea that it wouldn't be made to order.  It was obviously made sometime earlier during the day and placed in the fridge.  I was not a fan of this as I would have much preferred a warm chicken wrap that was made to order.  I guess I should have known that it would literally be chilled since the name of the wrap contains the word ""cool.""  The wrap tasted okay and filled me up but really wasn't anything special.  I wouldn't order it again and don't recommend it.

* Chicken Salad Sandwich (510 calories) - ""Freshly made at each Restaurant, this tasty sandwich is made with chunks of our Chick-fil-A chicken breast, chopped eggs, celery, sweet pickle relish and mayonnaise served chilled with Green Leaf lettuce on toasted Wheatberry bread.""  Unfortunately, like the Cool Wrap, this sandwich is also pre-made early in the day and refrigerated.  This sandwich was decent, but I would have never known that it was from Chick-fil-A by the taste alone.  It could have come from a supermarket or gas station.  Again, I was disappointed and would not order this again or recommend it.

I just looked up the calorie count in a Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich, and I'm shocked that it's only 290 calories vs. the 410 calories in the Cool Wrap and 510 calories in the Chicken Salad Sandwich.  I also can't believe that at 440 calories, an Original Chicken Sandwich has less calories than the Chicken Salad Sandwich.  Really?!  I seriously want a Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich now.  Too bad it's Sunday and I can't get one...

Overall, this Chick-fil-A still gets 4 stars because the drive-thru service was fast and friendly.  And although I haven't had their ""normal"" (non-healthy!) fast food items here nor dined in, I'm willing to bet it's as delicious as any other Chick-fil-A and probably clean inside.  I'll be sure to update my review once I've had a chance to dine in and enjoy a full, fatty Chicken Sandwich meal very soon...

Side Note: Why doesn't Chick-fil-A serve regular (not Reduced Fat Berry-flavored) Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing?  Their Berry Balsamic is too sweet for my taste.  PLEASE give us the option to get regular (or reduced fat) Balsamic Vinaigrette!

The #3 combo (spicy chicken sandwich with extra pickles, waffle fries, and a large diet lemonade) is everything.  Seriously it is so good.  This is coming from someone who doesn't eat fast food (aside from Cookout and Bojangles and alcohol is generally involved with those dining choices).  Their chicken nuggets with Polynesian sauce are addictive and a really challenge of self control to not eat like a million of them.  Their fresh fruit is actually really good, which is extra impressive because fast food fruit is in and of itself a scary thought.  They are one of the few restaurants that serve Diet Doctor Pepper.  In general, what's not to love.

However, my ""home base"" Chick-fil-A here simply goes beyond in customer service.  It's always clean and the employees are always nice and professional.  They give my dog a bone and me a gift card whenever the wait is really long.  Today I stopped in and picked up a gallon of their amazing diet lemonade to go.

1273,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"The only bad thing about this Chick-fil-A location is the traffic outside, but that's expected at the busy intersection of Peachtree and Collier.  You'll have to be patient getting into and out of this place, especially during peak times.  It's not as bad in the evenings or weekends, which are the times I've mostly visited this location.

From the street, it doesn't look like there's a lot of parking, but there's actually a lot of parking in a hidden lot in the back.  This Chick-fil-A has free Wi-Fi with decent speeds, a functional drive-thru, and an indoor playground with slide for kids.  Consistent with other Chick-fil-As, service is very good -- friendly and attentive.

It's hard to go wrong with any of the menu items.  I usually spring for the spicy chicken sandwich combo (around $6) or the nuggets (about $4-5 for a dozen).  The food quality at this location is on par with the others.  I prefer the Polynesian sauce (sweet and sour), but consider mixing it up and trying the Chick-fil-A sauce or buttermilk ranch sauce if you've never tried them before.  Chick-fil-A sauce is mildly ""mustardy,"" smoky, and sweet.  I'm not a fan of the buffalo sauce. I think it's too salty and overpowering.

Sweet tea is excellent.  It's super sweet and addictive.  Hello, diabetes.

The waffle fries are always good.  If you want to eat healthy, you can swap them out for a fruit cup.

I decided to go the full-service route (on a barstool since I was alone on business), and am glad I did. One review suggested the regular chicken sandwich was bigger & better than other Chick-Fil-A restaurants, but I disagree. It tasted exactly the same as the ones in Texas, and I actually think the chicken was smaller here. So don't order the standard chicken sandwich if you go there -- get one of the unique items. I wasn't able to find a menu of the unique items online (and the lady on the phone didn't seem interested in giving me a comprehensive list over the phone), so maybe this list will help some of you that are wondering just HOW different the full-service menu is:

Lunch/Dinner menu (in addition to normal stuff):
One-piece plate, two-piece plate, chargrilled one-piece plate, chargrilled two-piece plate, steak plate, Hot Brown (other reviews describe this), hamburger plate, midnight sandwich (ham & cheese), ham/bacon lettuce tomato sandwich, giant burger, steak sandwich, dwarf burger, grilled cheese sandwich, kids meal.

Vegetables:
fried okra, fried peas, collard greens, mashed potatoes, sweet potato souffle, cornbread, mac & cheese, kernel corn, green beans, broccoli & cheese. Also note they serve ""straight"" fries if you ask for them instead of the traditional waffle fries (I only saw waffle fries on their menu sign but was able to order straight fries).

Breakfast (served all day):
Eggs & toast & grits (bacon, ham, or sausage optional), steak & eggs, Chick-Fil-A chicken & eggs, chicken egg & cheese bagel, waffle, cinnamon cluster, etc.

And they have individual slices of pies - some fried and some regular. I had the lemon and it was great (tart but that's how I like it).

I tried the regular chicken sandwich (same as everywhere), dwarf burger (small but perfect when sampling other things too), straight fries (pretty standard fries - medium size sticks -- fatter than other fast food fries), and a small slice of lemon pie (the most enjoyable thing I ordered, which is how it's supposed to work). 

I'd love to go back someday and try some of the other unusual items on the menu -- including breakfast!

Forget the silly ""eat more chicken"" ads because when you're at a Dwarf House, all bets are off. Everything from the classic chicken sandwiches to burgers to God's gift to world - HOT BROWNS - can be found on this menu. It's also not fast food. You sit, a server takes your order, you wait for it to be cooked. It does come out quickly, but it's not sitting under a heat lamp for hours waiting for you. Prices are the same if you average it all out, and it's classic Chick-fil-a at it's best.

The neat thing about this location, though, is that it's the original. Yup, it all started here, folks. Everything from that tiny red door (which I still fit through, by the way...) to a diner look and feel to those silly paper hats rest inside these hallowed walls.

Don't come here and get what you can get at any location around the country. Come here and get things you can't get elsewhere, like the Hot Brown or a salad with Chick-fil-a's House dressing, all served ONLY at Dwarf House locations which, of course, are only in the Atlanta area.

1330,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"If there isn't an ounce of nostalgia or regard for Chick-fil-A history in your bones, then coming here really is unnecessary. But if you really do love Chick-fil-A a lot, are a chicken sandwich addict, want to try items that you can't get anywhere else and have a soft side for their history, then you must make this pilgrimage to Atlanta.

Yes, this is THE original location of Chick-fil-A, where what I believe to be the greatest chicken sandwich was ever created. 

Everything about this restaurant is different from your typical Chick-fil-A. First, this location is open just about around the clock. They also have servers to provide table service and there are a plethora of non-typical Chick-fil-A items to choose from on their menu. They have various platters, lots of sides, salads, soups, special sides, dessert and breakfast platters. When we went, if I didn't know any better, I would have thought I was in some random diner that just happened to specialize in chicken.

As a major foodie, I had done my fair share of research prior to coming here so my wife and I thought we knew what was best to get. Every article and review pointed to the Hot Brown as their signature dish, so I went with that. It came with a salad, but who's getting salad at Chick-fil-A? C'mon. I swapped out the salad for waffle fries. My wife ordered the Grilled Chicken Melt Platter with Waffle Fries and Fried Okra. 

The verdict? Meh and meh. Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered. I read the description on the menu and wasn't too excited about the Hot Brown, but I proceeded against my own will anyway. I should have listened to my gut. The Hot Brown was this unappetizing combo of chopped chicken, cream sauce and cheddar cheese. It was a gooey mess in a small tray that pretty much tasted like it sounded. I couldn't get a grip of the flavor of the chicken because the cream sauce and cheese dominated it. The gooeyness of the dish was a turnoff too. My wife wasn't a fan of her chicken melt platter either. It was all very plain and didn't have much flavor to it.

When we first walked in, all I could think about was what I typically ordered at Chick-fil-As (nuggets) and why I loved the chain and my word of advice to any customers visiting is DO NOT DIVERT FROM THAT. Go with your gut and the reasons you loved Chick-fil-A in the first place. Don't try to get fancy and order things that just don't sound good, even if it's their ""signature"" dish. You'll enjoy your experience a lot more here. I'm not deterring anyone from trying new things, but in this instance, stick with the chicken you know and love.

Besides the platters we ordered, we both also ordered a Frosted Lemonade, which was something we hadn't seen elsewhere. The best way to describe it was like a creamsicle lemonade shake. It was better than I thought it would be, so that's a win there.

The service was decent here and quick. I wouldn't say the employees were friendly, but in no way were they hostile either. Most were young and just did their jobs, but didn't go out of their way to converse with customers.

Like I said, coming here won't be for everyone.

1332,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"First, my friend was the one who wanted to go to Chick-fil-A. Second, I agreed when I researched this location was the first of its breed.

Private parking lot is huge, plenty of spaces. There is a drive-through, quick fast food express, and seat-in diner. Whatever your needs may be. Due to its age, there are some worn down areas but still maintained well. 

FOOD:
Spicy Deluxe Chicken Sandwich (4/5): These are good. Can't complain much, but they're not as spicy as when they initially arrived on the menu.

Grilled Chicken Melt Platter (3/5): I went for the healthy option and wanted to try this. It's very greasy once you eat it.

Mac & Cheese (2/5): The cheese was lacking. It was like eating watered down mac & cheese. I'd pass on this.

Sweet Potato Souffle (2/5): Too, too sweet. Barely touched.

Carrot & Raisin Salad (2/5): I've experienced better. Flavor was lacking. Luby's salad is delicious.

Cole Slaw (2/5): I've experienced better. Flavor was lacking. The BBQ joints have better slaw than this.

Our server was very friendly. Our water did touch bottom though. I do recommend sitting in the diner to try other items featured in ""Little Dwarf House"" (prior to becoming Chick-fil-A).

I decided to visit the dwarf house tonight and it just did not live up to the typical chickfila standards. For one, the service was not good. The girl who took our order was not friendly. She didn't smile at all. She was super dry and we thought that maybe she was having a bad day so we tried to make a joke with her and she was not here for it. She continued to look at us crazy and said ""I'm just waiting for you to order"". She proceeded to ring us up, give our total and left the register.

It started with a Z and she had blonde and black braids. 

The other issue was the food. It just wasn't good. The fries were cold. The grilled nuggets and classic chicken sandwiches just didn't taste good at all. Overall I wont be back.

1336,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"The Dwarf House in Hapeville is an institution.  Hapeville prides itself on being the home of the original Chick-Fil-A.

I doubt there's anything on their menu I have not had.  Growing up in Hapeville, we either had takeout or dined-in at least once, sometimes twice a week.  In high school, this place was the hangout for us all to meet up after our dates.

The drive-through options are minimal compared to the dine-in menu, but those with an addiction to Chick-fil-a don't seem to mind.  The place gets so crowded during lunch that a cop has to direct traffic going in and out of the restaurant's parking lot on weekdays.

The atmosphere is nothing fancy--a diner feel with an animated moving dwarf picture on the back wall showing the seven dwarves going in and out of the coal mine.  As a kid, this intrigued me for hours.  I still get excited when I see the picture--ahhh memories.  Most of the waitresses and managers have been working there for many, many years and know their customers on a first-name and favorite dish basis.  I always like to see the number of years serving on my waitress' name tag--it's usually upwards of 15 years. 

Some of my favorites here are the Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich (fried chicken breast between a buttery bun with a few pickles) chicken biscuits, gravy, coleslaw and hot browns.  For dessert--mmmmmmm, the apple pie, peach pie or chocolate icebox pies are great.  They also have the best soft-serve ice cream EVER.  Therefore, their hand-spun milkshakes will make you think you've died and gone to heaven.

If you come to Atlanta, especially to the airport area, visit the original Chick-fil-a.

I took away one star because their chicken biscuits have gotten smaller over the years.  Other than that, I don't know what I would do without Chick-fil-a, and I think many people can agree.",  Dwarf House Hapeville institution Hapeville pride home original Chick Fil doubt anything menu Growing Hapeville either takeout din least sometimes twice week high school place hangout us meet date drive option minimal compare dine menu addiction Chick fil seem mind place get crowded lunch cop direct traffic go restaurant parking lot weekday atmosphere nothing fancy diner feel animated moving dwarf picture back wall show seven dwarf go coal mine kid intrigue hour still get excited see picture ahhh memory waitress manager work many many year know customer first name favorite dish basis always like see number year serve waitress name tag usually upwards year favorite Chick Fil chicken sandwich fry chicken breast buttery bun pickle chicken biscuit gravy coleslaw hot brown dessert mmmmmmm apple pie peach pie chocolate icebox pie great also best soft serve ice cream EVER Therefore hand spun milkshake make think die go heaven come Atlanta especially airport area visit original Chick fil take away one star chicken biscuit get small year know would without Chick fil think many people agree,0.11939999999999998,Positive

I have not ever rated a Chick-Fil-A location with less than 5 Stars as the service has always been exemplary at each site. My first issue was with the parking, it is very tight and on both occasions, I had to circle the lot numerous times to find somebody leaving to get a space. 

Inside the place was packed, I was able to use the restroom to wash my hands and then ordered at the counter and ate inside my car since there were no tables open for indoor seating. This is a very busy location and like all other Chick-Fil-A's the service was very fast and efficient with 100% order accuracy. The spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries were on point as always. 

I would like to return and try the Diner side when back in the area. 

One negative, on both my visits I was approached by several street people who were begging for money. They met me as soon as I got out of my car and as I tried to get back inside.

1370,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"My five star rating is based on the fact that this is a fast food chain, so as far as fast food goes, this is as good as it gets!

I've heard the positive buzz about this place since I started traveling south for work a few years ago, but for some reason, have never tried out a Chick-Fil-A until now. All those wasted trips south when I could have been enjoying this goodness, what was I thinking???

I tried the simple chicken sandwich which comes on a butter-toasted bun garnished with pickles. I added mustard myself. They claim to make the original chicken sandwich. While I'm not sure if this is entirely true, I can say that if it is, all those that have come afterwards have failed miserably! The chicken is real, juicy and tasty, I can say enough about how good it is.

I love the waffle fries too, not greasy, nice and crispy and not loaded with salt. I read as well that the chicken nuggets are awesome, so I decided to pig it up and got myself an 8 piece order. I decided to try the Polynesian sauce and the honey barbecue sauce. The Polynesian was forgettable, but the honey barbecue was amazing! I could put this stuff on ice cream and enjoy it!

One neat thing was the fact that they have a person walking around the dining area asking if you'd like a refill on your drink or to remove your tray. A nice little touch I've never seen before in a fast food restaurant.

1374,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"In light of recent statements made by Dan Cathy (President and COO of Chick-fil-A) that have sparked controversy, I have to admit that I love Chick-fil-A.  I realize that even the simple act of writing this review may cause some frustration/anger/hate from some Yelpers, so let's just leave it at that...

After checking out some apartments close by on a Saturday afternoon, my siblings and I decided to stop at this Chick-fil-A for a quick lunch.  It was around 3 pm, so the lunch rush was obviously over and the restaurant was pretty dead.  There were maybe two or three other customers aside from us.  

Since it was so quiet, I thought it was odd that there were at least five employees behind the counter.  I guess it's their usual Saturday staff, but they seemed to be joking and playing around instead of focusing on their job.  (Perhaps this has something to do with the aforementioned controversy?)

I ordered a Spicy Chicken sandwich (no pickles!) meal with waffle fries and a Diet Dr. Pepper.  (I LOVE that Chick-fil-A restaurants have Diet Dr. Pepper!  My 2nd favorite drink only after Coke Zero.)  The employees were friendly enough and our food was served quickly.  However, as snooty as this may sound, I noticed that the employee who handed me my drink didn't bother to wipe the sides of the cup where soda had spilled over.  (Note:  They normally DO this!  Even most other fast food restaurants do it!)  That was the first thing that bugged me.

As we walked around to decide where to sit, we noticed that many of the tables didn't look clean.  They probably hadn't wiped anything down since that morning.  We finally chose a booth table to sit at, but there were crumbs on the seat, too.  Annoying.

When we opened up our sandwiches to dig in, we all agreed that it looked like the chicken fillet had gotten flatter/thinner over the past year or so that we have dined at Chick-fil-A.  I recall when the Spicy Chicken sandwich was first introduced at Chick-fil-A about two years ago, the chicken fillet was LARGE and I was super stuffed by the time I finished.  This time around, however, I was disappointed that the size and quality of the chicken seems to have declined.  Not cool.

Similar to the dining area, the women's restroom looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in HOURS.  The trash bin for paper towels was OVERFLOWING.  With so many employees during a very quiet time of the day, this was unacceptable.  I did, however, appreciate the complimentary mouth wash and tiny disposable cups above the sink.

Overall, this Chick-fil-A gets 2.5 stars because it is just not up to par with other Chick-fil-A restaurants, especially the awesome ones I've gotten used to up in Buford.  Hopefully management will become aware of these issues (I highly doubt it was an anomaly) and work to ensure their employees actually do their jobs and at least act like they care.

He said it's unusual to go to a Chick-fil-a where they don't give great service so when he encountered the rude employees here he felt Chick-fil-a and people in general should know. He said there was no smiling and any of the niceness that the restaurant is known for. Also, when his food was ready the young lady who had his food in her hand didn't call his name, waited for him to approach her (even though he was standing right there), and when he did approach her about his food, she didn't look at him at all. She handed him his food as if he waa bothering her.

It's easy to get in and out. The parking lot is large, and there is a drive thru. 

Inside you'll find a surprisingly upscale fast food environment. I was really impressed by the overall interior decor. There's a small kid's play area. A minor point; there isn't a self service drink station. So, anytime you want a refill you have to bother an employee. A small annoyance. WiFi is available. Don't forget they're closed on Sundays. 

It's fast food, but I was impressed with the number of fairly healthy options. Grilled chicken sandwiches, salads, and grilled chicken tenders along with the traditional fried versions. I opted for the grilled chicken sandwich (about $4.50). A wheat bun (gluten free available for $1.50 more), large chicken breast, lettuce, and tomato. This was an excellent choice. Perfectly and simply prepared juicy chicken perfectly complemented by the cool lettuce and tomato without any heavy sauces. Outstanding! Combo meals are of course available and served with their awesome waffle fries (or a selection of healthier choices). Indulge in the fries once in a while, though. Crispy outside and fluffy inside without being greasy. 

The staff were extremely friendly and gracious.  After you order, you stand to the side and wait for your name to be called. Staff thanked everyone in a really genuine manner.

Ambiance
The inside is all clean and new, and it has a modern (dare I even say upscale) interior. There is a small children's play area and of course a drive thru. 

Service
Everyone was quite friendly inside, and there was almost no line at noon on a weekday (there was a bit of a drive thru line). When I received my order and said thank you the employee said ""my pleasure"" which is always such a classy response more akin to a high end hotel or restaurant. 

Food
Two words - waffle fries. Try these!  They are very, very good. Crispy outside with a fluffy potato interior. The chicken sandwich had a good sized juicy fried chicken breast with a mildly crunchy coating as well as a few pickles. Personally I like this simplicity without heavy sauces or cheese. Their coatings (on sandwiches and nuggets) tend to be ""wetter"" and a bit less of a ""dry"" type of crunchy than their competitors. The sandwich itself runs about $3.50, but I had a free meal card they had been mailing out to generate business for their new location. Check your mail for these!  They give you one free item a month for February, March, and April. Overall their food is definitely higher quality when compared to other fast food venues.

1455,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I have great excitement building for Monday's Chic-Fil-A Spicy Chicken sandwich launch. I usually only get this excited when McD rolls out the Shamrock and McRib combo each spring. Burger King has been trying to seduce me with a rib on an actual bone, but there's no chance I touch those. Honestly has anyone ever seen a BK with a health score above 80? I can't do BK. If feels like having to use the loo at a Marshalls. No thank you, I'll squeeze the cheeks and wait it out. 

So CFA is plastering a marketing campaign (sans cows?!?) all over ESPN this week with the the following description about their new Spicy Chicken sandwich... ""Tastes like a chicken got jumped by a pepper factory, inside a volcano, on the surface of the sun."" 

Really... that spicy? I hope not because this sandwich has the potential to be my new go-to fast food delicacy, and I would hate to have it be too spicy and go the way of the Garden Whopper. Remember those? Didn't think so, they were terrible. 

Granted I am of Scandinavian decent, no latin in me (unfortunately - I'd love to have an omnipresent tan and be able to roll my R's with reason.) Still I do enjoy spicy food. I'll do some jalepenos at a Mexican joint, or General Zhao chicken, or even some Tandori chicken. So call me slightly above middle of the road Yanks in ability to handle and affinity for spicy food. CFA, if the new sandwich is too spicy for me, it will be too spicy for America. And you don't want that. We want an alternative to the current best fast food spicy chicken option, the belt currently hangs on Wendy's waist.

CFA execs I know you read my FB page, so let me help explain where you need to spice this thing in the best way I can; Latina Levels of Spicy

Minimalist Spice, or the Catherine Zeta Jones.
Catherine Zeta Jones sounds like she'd be Latino. She's perhaps best known for her roles in the Zoro series where she plays a Mexican. But Zeta Jones is actually Welsh! Who knew?!? Similarly the sandwiches here are not much different than the regular chicken sandwiches on the menu. They may dust it with some paprika and charge an extra buck for it. McDonald's offering is here. No different than the original, so very skippable.

Mid Spice, or the Selena Gomez.
Definitely latin so there is some inherent spice; but still on Disney Channel so very PG. This is a good place for CFA to spice their sandwich. Ideally they land it here and I'd be all over it. Popeye's spicy chicken is at this level. Too bad Popeye's doesn't understand how to run a drive thru or I'd go there more often. I can pluck my own chicken in the time it takes to get those lard and butter biscuit beauties out the window and into my car. A shame really. CFA - this is your sweet spot.

Dang Spicy, or the Penelope Cruz
Very latin, slightly crazy, and deducting huge points for being with Tom Cruz who is justifiably insane (although I will see his summer movie with Cameron Diaz, great casting for Tom, but he's still crazy.) Wendy's current champ in the spicy chicken sandwich category is here, and it's my favorite option. But every time I enjoy one I do have to dab the forehead after each bite. And when you spend as much time as I do prepping my Scandinavian pale skin for forays into public, I can't be dabbing off moisturizer and suntan lotion. Just a bit too spicy but still a nice option.

Dangerously Over Spiced, of the Dominican Woman
Forgive the title, I don't really mean to throw all Dominican women into this category. Truthfully I only know one. She's the wife of a guy I work with. When first meeting her at a company function, her husband leans over and in all seriousness says... ""careful, she may look sweet but she's Dominican, she'll pull a knife on ya!"" No smile on his face. Completely serious. And by the end of the night, I could see the crazy coming out of this woman's ears. No knives were pulled, but I stayed on the other side of the dinner table. You can only get a fast food option this spicy at an authentic Mexican drive thru place. The kind of place where the menu is in Spanish and they only take cash. But if you want a super spicy anything, this is your place. 

When Monday's lunch comes and I hike it over to CFA and get my waffle fries, sweet tea and new spicy sandwich; please CFA, make it a Selena Gomez and not a Dominican jumped by a pepper mill on the face of the sun... everyone knows if you jump a Dominican they pull their knives.

I walked over to this spot today as it was such a nice day. This Chick Fil A is located at the Terminus building where such other places like Lola Bellini, Aquaknox, Bricktops and Flying Biscuit. I would think this place attracts more of the office crowd during lunch time. The place is smaller than the conventional restaurant and they have a pretty large patio area. 

The interior of the resturant gets an A+ because of the cleanliness. Secondly, it's get's a A+ in customer service, the clerk (she was an area director) was extremely friendly, charming and she actually brought out my meal. You can tell their number one mission is customer satisfaction and I can see (at least at this location) they are serious aboutAt The Terminus Building.

I had the grilled chicken sandwich, with the waffle fries and coke zero. The waffle fries were as good as always and the sandwich was decent. Unfortunately the grilled breast was a little on the small side and the bun, which wasn't bad, was a little over-bearing. Other than that; it was a decent meal and the quality overall was very good.

Holy Cow, really?!
My wife specifically asked when ordering for 4 salad dressings to go with our 2 salads.  When the guy brought it out of the back kitchen she asked again specifically if they were in there, he said yes (she glanced in and saw at least 2).  Well, you know where this is going,... there were only the 2 dressings in there (so, I had to walk back to my wife's work building to get 1, and use up even more of my lunchtime).

I like their buffalo sauce & srachia (wrong spelling lol.) I also love their milk shakes which are similar to Burger King's.

I also go as far as taking the survey that comes sometimes on the bottom of the receipt that gets you a free chicken sandwich! Why not? Takes 5 minutes. Service is really friendly here.

1480,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"Let me preface by saying I am a huge Chick-fil-A fan and due to the unfortunate fact that there isn't one in Cambridge/Boston, I exclusively drive 30 minutes to get my spicy chicken deluxe here. Whenever I go on a road trip, Chick-fil-A is where I get breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I have visited many locations and this one is objectively the worst in service quality.

Well, the service would be acceptable if this were Taco Bell or McDonald's but because Chick-fil-A is renowned for its excellent service, this location is a disappointment. 

I have had my order messed up on three separate occasions with all orders placed via the mobile app, which makes it even less excusable. If any employee at this location paid even the slightest bit of attention, someone would have noticed that an entire box of chicken nugget was missing, a chicken filet (they even printed the correct label for it on the box) became a chicken sandwich, or the fork that I requested was nowhere in the bag. You know what's even worse? Water cups without straws. How can something so routine that it should be muscle memory at this point be messed up? How do you work the drive-through for more than 30 minutes and not automatically include a straw for every drink you hand over? 

I normally would let this slide but because they closed dine-in due to COVID-19, we had to do curbside pickup. The whole point is to avoid contact and interaction as much as possible but because I paid for my damn chicken nuggets, I had to drive back, get out of my car, risk infecting you / getting infected myself to ask for my paid chicken nuggets. The employee seemed nonchalant about this whole situation and didn't apologize for screwing this up probably because they messed up so much that they are desensitized to it.

I believe what I experienced is just a symptom of a bigger underlying problem of hiring unmotivated workers who do not care about what Chick-fil-A stands for. In this world where poor service and shaky values are ubiquitous, Chick-fil-A is a beacon that attracts customers for its delicious food, solid values, and more importantly, quality service. It's one of the few restaurants, accessible to all economic classes, where you can expect to be treated with respect, courtesy, and care. By those metrics, this location is an utter failure and only tarnishes the name that the other locations uphold. 

I was going to give this location a one star rating. However, the food that I did get is still delicious, perhaps more of a testament to Chick-fil-A's recipe rather than this location's ability to run a successful franchise so I will add one additional star.

The spicy chicken sandwich was quite satisfying. The chicken was thick and juicy, the tomato slices, lettuce, pickles tasted fresh. Only thing is that the bread was a bit too soft (but I wasn't expecting a gourmet brioche bun).
The waffle fries were nice and hot, though some were are bit soggy. I would have preferred them more crispy, but overall taste was good/not too salty or bland.

1492,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"The Chick-fil-A at Cobb Parkway and Akers Mill is drive-thru only.  This location has a triple drive-thru.

Drivers in:
Drive-thru Lane #1 pick up food on the passenger side.
Drive-thru Lane #2 pick up food on the driver side.
Drive-thru Lane #3 pick up food on the driver side.

All lanes are staffed by CFA employees.  Lanes 1 and 2 are connected directly to the kitchen.  Lane 3 receives orders via a conveyor system.  The menus and ordering stations are semi-covered, so you won't get as wet when it rains.

If you're traveling alone, I'd recommend lanes 2 or 3 for convenience's sake.  I took lane 1 one time and the CFA employee was waiting for me, sitting on the window ledge, when I pulled up.  Her sitting on the ledge maximized her length of reach into my car.  Great service is consistent across virtually all Chick-fil-A's, including this drive-thru.

In addition to the drive-thru, there are two walk-up windows, so you can park your car at the Chipotle next door and walk over.  There are a few tables with umbrellas on the small sidewalk outside.  I wouldn't eat there during a peak time, though, because you'd constantly have idling automobiles and all their fumes flanking you on either side.

The food is just as good as the standalone stores.  My favorites continue to be the classic Chicken Sandwich and Spicy Chicken Sandwich and their perfectly sweet Sweet Tea.  Be sure to ask for extra napkins and any condiments you'd like on the way out.  CFA has six sauces you can choose from: BBQ, Buffalo, Buttermilk Ranch, Chick-fil-A, Honey Mustard, and Polynesian.

He threw up his hands walking to the window, and SAID (WHAT NOW) VERY LOUDLY?! I asked him about the new policy, and he said they can no longer cook food well done.

She then took the sandwich had them put a cold piece of cheese on the sandwich. I looked at it, and told her they where suppose to have re made my sandwich. Also, it was the incorrect sandwich, and she got a attitude again. I asked for the manager YOSSI again, and he came to the window. I complained about my food being incorrect, and my order always being incorrect. I also complained about joys nasty attitude, and how she is very prejudice being that I'm African American. I told him I've never had a horrible experience like this ever at a chik fi li restaurant, and she do not need to be working for this company. She is a horrible representative for this corporation and he just knodded his head then walked off not saying anything.

I ordered the chicken deluxe sandwich meal (sandwich, fries, and soda). The employees were extremely pleasant and helped me with my order, as I had never been to a Chick-fil-A before. I got through the drive-thru in less than 15 minutes and arrived home 5 minutes later.

Unfortunately the fries were VERY dry and tasteless and only made marginally better with the fry sauce (keep in mind these are not normal fries they are waffle fries). The chicken sandwich should be the star of the show, but it was a little dry and kind of tasteless. You can tell the chicken in the sandwich is quality breast, but if you cook it too long it becomes dry and tasteless. 

I will give them another try someday, but I think it won't be for awhile as the wait is just too long right now. Maybe after the hype dies down I can eat inside to see if it tastes better right out of the deep fryer.

I waited about a week after the first opening, because I did not want to wait in that ridiculously long line. Once I did go the line was still long, but the efficiency that they had was unbelievable-- I was super impressed. There were two lines (in the drive thru) and had multiple ""stations"" where you'd first get a menu, the next you'd get your order taken, the next you'd get your sauces, the next you'd pay, and at the last you'd get your food. All in all your trip would only max out to be about 15 minutes in line, which I thought was amazing for only being open for a week.

Despite having ordered everything custom (spicy chicken sandwich with extra pickles and waffle fries with no salt), the food came out quickly and it was hot and just like i had in Arizona a couple weeks ago.  

The restaurant gets mobbed.  When i left there was a line out the door.  They have someone directing traffic near the entrance and there was a bike cop nearby (not sure if he was there to help or give out traffic tickets).  They have tons of people working there for the opening and several people asked if they could get me anything else.  My only complaint is that all Chickfila stores should carry Tabasco sauce.  I don't want to put Texas Pete on my sandwich, nothing personal against them but taking away Tabasco is like taking away the pickles.",  grow Georgia course big fan Chickfila opening new restaurant Tanasabourne longer wait travel get chicken nugget waffle fry stop today around try beat lunch crowd get parking spot front door minute wait line Despite order everything custom spicy chicken sandwich extra pickle waffle fry salt food come quickly hot like Arizona couple week ago restaurant get mob leave line door someone direct traffic near entrance bike cop nearby sure help give traffic ticket ton people work opening several people ask could get anything else complaint Chickfila store carry Tabasco sauce want put Texas Pete sandwich nothing personal take away Tabasco like take away pickle,-0.03446969696969696,Negative

1517,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"It's just a chicken sandwich store. While the company have had many run-ins with the current political and socio economic platforms of the many, it is still just a chicken place.

This glorification is insane and overly dramatic.

Maybe I should pray to whoever that may the servers be not polite and have sharp snark like their urban counterparts. How we can wish that they will stop showering and grow a facial hair and change their overall shirt colors to  black and alter their uniforms to ""Goodwill"" chic. 

I also wish that they can spare one of their chickens to join the Lents Chicken Beauty pageant for summer (when it is available cause it is a thing to witness). If the POTUS can pardon one turkey for Thanksgiving, I'm sure Chick Fil A can pardon one hen to join a pageant. 

In all seriousness, if you see that the drive through line is long, park and go inside. Their take out system flows so smooth and fast. Plus you won't feel guilty devouring your food cause you already burned some calories walking and opening the door. There is ample parking space. 

The chicken itself is decent. It is chicken unlike other fast-food joints where you'll have second thoughts if what you're really chewing is chicken. For texture, it does feel like it's chicken. For taste, it is as bland as a chicken raised in a farm in the midwest.

1534,Chick-fil-A,1.0,"I tried, really. The idea of a fast food chicken sandwich that's actually good is an enticing idea. Once in a while, it's ok, but I have had three poor experiences in six since they opened and really, that's pathetic. I don't think I'll try number seven.

The first time, I had a terrible sandwich - it was just bad. I responded to their ask for a review in their app and I was sent a couple cards for free sandwiches, but it took a long time for me to bother to return. 

When I did return (this is the second time), I tried to use the cards but that turned into a fiasco because the entire order had to be rebuilt because the cashier didn't know how to use the cards. I spent 15 minutes placing an order for two meals. Silly. The order ended up being wrong.

The third time, a few days ago, we ordered three meals for carry-out. We left with one incorrect sandwich (that could not be eaten) and two extra orders of fries that we didn't order but were charged for, anyway. All of that was literally crammed into two bags that were over full and could not be closed, so guess what? Cold incorrect orders. (But hey, at least they saved the cost of a bag, right?) The kids ate and I had a lot of cold fries. The best part is that notifying the location and the corporate office did nothing at all - no response from either.

I remember CFA from many, many years ago at Clackamas Town Center.  They occupied the corner space, above the skating rink, and down from the arcade.  They'd often be handing out nugget samples, and I enjoyed more than a few.  Super tasty!  I didn't really lament their departure, or really even notice for that matter.  It wasn't until years later, and the same-sex marriage controversy with the chain, that I remembered they even existed.

Obviously their grand opening was an ""event"".  Initially I visited the store a few weeks after it opened, and was greeted with 40+ cars in line.  I've only been through the drive-thru.  The line went fast.  Their customer service is top notch, and it's a nice touch that they ask for your name at the beginning of the order.  I think the prices are reasonable for high quality fast food.  So the sandwich, yes, it's very good.  Tasty fried chicken breast, with pickles, on a bun.  That's the standard version.  I recommend the following - upgrade to a multigrain bun.  Omit the pickles.  Add cheese + bacon, and dump the sauce of your choice on the sandwich.  Honey is a good choice, or any of their other sweet sauces (Polynesian, CFA sauce).  Optional: put the waffle fries directly on the sandwich as well.  I've had their nuggets too, and while tasty, they're tiny.  If you're going this route, get 12, and not 8.  You'll be able to finish them, I assure you.

No lines inside but the drive thru was quite long. I was going to do 2 separate orders but as everything comes in a bag, one order it was- one CFA sandwich meal and two separate 
CFA sandwiches, without pickles. Oh, all seven sauces (totally forgot the cheese sauce until after!) The order was called back and I waited a few minutes before another employee brought my order and repeated the order. 

The sandwiches without pickles were clearly marked and the fries were hot. The sandwich was perfect, never seen such a perfect bun and warm chicken! It was fun trying all the sauces- some were too watery and salty but I kept going back to the garlic & herb ranch (I normally do not like ranch), which was a nice balance. The half tea, half lemonade was great too, really nice and refreshing. 

With a casual atmosphere and food kept simple plus done right as well as friendly employees, I see the obsession! The soft instrumental praise music was subtle and the motion detected trash disposal were all perks, but a little steep I thought. For a meal it was a little over 7.50 and one CFA sandwich came out to be over 4. Maybe I haven't had fast food in a while but thought it was a tad more than what I used to pay.

They took our order & before the payment process was complete our food was in front of us on the counter. Hmmm, that's interesting, it usually takes a little while. We took the tray and sat down to eat. When I opened the box there was a tired old sandwich with a dry bun, the tomatoes & pickles were in disarray & the lettuce was wilted. It was only warm to the touch. My husband's chicken strips were hot, but really greasy. I guess they got a quick dip in the hot oil to renew them. The waffle fries were warm and not crisp. I was going to get up & take it back to them and when I turned around there were 6 people in line & the staff was running around like crazy.

1564,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I thought I reviewed this location already but in case I didn't, here's another. :-)

East side? West Side? Which one is better? Location-wise, I prefer this one. It's easier to get to from the highway, has better access and parking, and it's quite a bit larger. 

Food wise, it's pretty much the same. The menu and pricing is exactly the same. The service is good at both as well. They are both fast and or slow depending on the hour and traffic. This location has been open just a couple of weeks longer, so you wont gain anything from more experienced employees. 

I've taken quite a few friends and family members here, and every single one has remarked, and I've notice myself, that for a brand new establishment, they have REALLY got this grand opening thing down. Anyone who wants to learn about starting a business or crowd control needs to check out a Chick Fil A opening. No matter how crowded they are, or how long the wait, they keep the flow going at a steady pace, without taking any shortcuts. 

I've been here more than a dozen times (yikes! that's a lot since they've not even been open a few months.)

I came on grand opening day, although I did have to work, so by the time I arrived the lines were very VERY long. The drive thru line was stretched behind Target, but we parked and walked over. The line to eat in wrapped around the parking lot. It took about an hour to get in. 

I still haven't gotten around to trying everything on the menu, but I started out with the regular chicken sandwich, which is good. It's better with mayo or sauce. I like it with the chick fil a sauce. Hubby gets a spicy one and add buffalo. My favorite is the chicken wrap. I like the buttermilk ranch better than the garlic. Next time I will try the BBQ. 

I really like that they have Diet Lemonade,but I wish they sweetened it with stevia instead of artificial sweeteners. 

The waffle fries are very good, but a little bit bland. I always use plenty of sauce with them.

I reached for my wallet and noticed I didn't have it with me. I told him not to worry about the order and to cancel it.

The chicken breast was too thick for the minimal crusting that was on it, and it had no seasoning whatsoever. The only thing that had any taste was the one lonely pickle slice in the middle.

But on this visit it was even more special than the rest.  Today was ""Free Spicy Chicken Sandwich Day"".  They are the only chain I know that always gives back to the public by offering such freebies - - the Spicy Chicken Sandwich costs $3.09 and today it's free if you wear something that has your favorite sports team.  It's the 2nd time they've offered it free, and the best part it that it's actually a really good sandwich.  

Karen was our server, she was very attentive and smiled a lot.  We got our sandwiches and sat down in the dining area, about 15 min later Karen walked by us and asked if she could refill our drinks.  Wow!  So when did that ever happen at Mickey D's, the BK Lounge, or Taco Hell?  As Flo (Mel's Diner) would say:  ""When Donkey's FLY!!!"".  

So we put in a comment card, gave it to the Team Lead (Veronica?), who was also really sweet and nice.  Karen was jumping for joy since we mentioned her in the card, and I'm just shocked as I've never seen morale that high at any fast food establishment.  Part of me is wondering why the hell did I waste 2 yrs of my HS life working at Wendy's (well, it wasn't all a waste, we did have some great times, I ate a lot of frosties and cookies), while another part of me was thinking I may need to fill out an application and get in on this ""High-On-Chick-Fil-A-Life"" morale booster.  

I love their chicken, especially the tenders.  Their honey mustard and honey bbq sauces are THE BEST condiments I know (yes, better than Mickey D's ketchup).  They have waffle fries, fruit, fresh flowers (sweetheart roses and carnations) on each table, and excellent customer service that usually displayed with all 32 pearly whites.

The lemonade is so good and the IceDream cones are the best soft serve ice found.  Every Wednesday they have a special where you get a free order or nuggets or original chicken sandwich (it switches every week) when you buy a combo meal.  We also get the calendars for Christmas which give you a yummy freebie every month. 

Jose, the manager, is such a nice guy! We went through the drive-thru on Halloween last year and me, my guy, and our dog were all wearing costumes.  My dog Beau of course was sniffing the delicious smells and the girl working the drive they thought he was so cute in his costume that she called some other employees and Jose over to see him.  

Sadly they couldn't give him pets - but good job following food safety and health regulations - but Jose grabbed a box of nuggets and gave Beau his own 4-piece box!! Needless to say, every time we go back he now tries to climb out the window!! AND Jose has given him his own nuggets AGAIN every time he sees there!  I told him he is my dogs new bff.

The staff are always so cheerful and friendly! We always seem to be there when Jose is working and you can tell that the employees really respect him and like him as well.

1653,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"For fast food this is about as good as it gets, I think.  I pretty much always get the spicy chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato and cheese.  They are extremely consistent and the best fried chicken sandwich I've had at a fast food chain.

The chicken has been crunchy, juicy, hot and delicious every single time I've gotten it and while the fries are not always hot out of the fryer, at least a good chunk of the time they are, and they're still pretty good otherwise.  

I will say that there is a distinct difference between the appearance and attitudes of the employees here vs pretty much every other fast food chain I've been to.  They don't look lifeless and unhappy to be there, and are generally upbeat and noticeably friendlier which makes your decision to eat fast food not feel so depressing.

It was dark, foggy, and raining, and the drive thru line was long. But when you are amongst the masses of chicken sandwich lovers waiting in drive thru, you are practically with family, right?
Anyway, pouring rain, and an employee taps on our window and explains the line was so long because their ordering system lost connection and thus people were ordering at the window. He advised us to order through the mobile app if we could. No big deal, and I started downloading the app on my phone.
A manager comes out a few minutes later and apologizes and asks us if we were taken care of. At this point I was entering payment information into the app, and had our order almost done.  TWO employees, including a manager, were out in the POURING rain making sure their customers were taken care of.
By the time we made it to the window not much longer, our food was handed to us in the same amount of time it would have taken on a perfect day when everything was operational.  Talk about efficiency and customer service! I was WOWED.

1658,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"A review that is long overdue... this is the only chick-fil-a that I have been to in the PNW area, and definitely in the state of OR. It happens to be close to my husband's workplace, so I enjoy stopping by when I have the time and can't resist the craving, which is almost always in the morning. Originally from the south (ATL, Chick-fil-A HQ), my expectations are pretty high of this establishment in particular. Cedar Hills has gotten it right every time I have been here, which has been more than a handful of times. The food is always warm to hot, prepared correctly, and if for some reason they get it wrong, they are always quick to apologize and make it right. They have cute little SOS (save our sauce) signs near the trash receptacles to reduce waste, but still make sure customers are getting ample dipping sauces (a peeve of mine at other places that charge you for an extra bbq sauce... really?? I'm not going to run my card again for another $0.20 for sauce). The ladies restroom is always clean, though one little thing: the soap dispenser is a bit tricky with the dispensing sometimes.. there's always soap in there but the sensor is a bit finicky. Also, the prices for some of the menu items seems to be a bit higher compared to some other locations (e.g.: egg white grill breakfast entree), which I didn't realize varies by location. I enjoy the wordless music that is always playing at the appropriate volume level, so as not to deafen you or make conversation difficult, but still loud enough so that you can hear it clearly. They also offer FREE coffee with your breakfast before 10 AM, I believe... I may be off on the time a bit and I think it's dine-in only because I always dine in when I eat here. Service is always prompt, friendly, and polite. I don't understand what the bad reviews are about.. I've never had less-than-great service. Caveat though, I've never been here and found the place to be super busy, so who knows. Also, on a number of occasions that I've eaten here, I have seen the operator, Jared, walking around talking to employees or getting work done and checking on the place. This tells me that he cares about the establishment, maintaining quality, and keeping both customers and employees happy. (I have never spoken to him nor do I know him. Just letting you know what I've observed. I only realized who he was and what he looked like because he offered a complimentary chicken sandwich via the Chick-fil-A app after I'd visited this location multiple times, and it had a little photo of him next to the offer)

1681,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"Chick-fil-A has a great business model.  I've yet to patronize a CFA that doesn't have good chicken sandwiches, waffle fries, sweet tea, and fast and friendly service (well, except for maybe the CFA ""Express"" at Georgia Tech: http://www.yelp.com/biz/chick-fil-a-express-atlanta, but that's not a standard CFA anyway).

This Chick-fil-A is located inside the CNN Center food court.  As such, it shares seating with the other CNN Center eateries including Moe's, Great Wraps, Chinese/Japanese takeout joints, and other popular American fast food chains.  I stopped by this CFA to pick up dinner before an Atlanta Hawks game at adjacent Philips Arena.  The large open seating area was absolutely packed with fans.  There were so many people eating that some sat on the floor with their backs against the walls.  We shared a table with other folks.

Needless to say, this CFA was super busy.  Fortunately, they were prepared to handle the demand as there was an associate at every cash register.  We didn't have to wait in line more than a minute or two to place our orders and after that, no longer than an additional minute or so to receive our orders.  Kateeka was our server and she processed and delivered our orders politely and with a smile on her face.  It'd be nice if other fast food chains followed suit.

The classic Chicken Sandwich and the Spicy Chicken Sandwich are my favorites.  Only $5.95 and $6.19, respectively, for those sandwiches + medium waffle fries and a drink at this location.  Consistently good.  If you want to try out different dipping sauces for your fries or nuggets, ask for any of the Buffalo Sauce, Buttermilk Ranch, Chick-fil-A Sauce (tangy and smoky), Honey Mustard, or Polynesian Sauce (sweet and sour).

Well here's what I think: It's just aiteeee. 

--The waffle fries are as good as advertised, but certainly not better. 

--The chicken sandwich, if you don't eat it immediately, can get a little soggy on you. Now I understand that this is fast food, so I'm not expecting a lot in that respect given all of the grease inherent in making fast food so delicious...it's just that when I pick up take out and eat it only 15 minutes later, I still expect it to be on point.

My love for Chick-fil-A is as long as the lines I encounter every time I use the drive thru. I've never stepped foot into this location but the asphalt in the drive thru has the grooves of my tires enshrined in it.

What I indulge in;
- Breakfast Chicken Biscuit: A little bit on the salty side but definitely capable of putting a morning smile on your face. 
- Spicy chicken sandwich: you really really can't go wrong with this sandwich, super tasty with an adequate spicy factor.
- Chicken strips: usually with a side of their amazing waffle potato fries. This meal usually serves as an appetizer, if I need to satisfy my taste bubs before having a big meal later on.
- Polynesian Sauce: simply divine, I never order a meal without it.
- Milkshake: Not the best milkshakes you'll ever have but it's okay.

From my observation most locations in the Sandy Springs area are victims to this drive thru 'go slow', so expect to play the waiting game but, when you rummage through that white and red paper bag to the treasure within, the taste definitely never disappoints!

I ended up having two sandwiches because I was hungry and I got a free one. The charbroiled chicken club was great. It has lettuce, tomato, pickles, and charbroiled chicken, which tasted like it was seasoned by pepper. The basic chicken sandwich, which came free with the club, was just fried chicken and pickles.

Do people really prefer it that way? I couldn't tell what made the Spicy Chicken spicy--it might as well have been some injection from a laboratory solution labeled ""heat.""

1805,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"While the chicken in my sandwich was both moist and more than decent, this still remains a fast food chain and thus has it's limits in terms of both quality and nutrition. 

After a short drive over for some lunch with my girlfriend, we parked, crossed halfway across this mall and made our way to the food court and then to this Chick-Fil-A location. She had eaten at one of them before, in the south, but I had never had been to one. Although I don't eat much fastfood, if ever (In-N-Out aside!), I was rather excited at the prospect that this could be a decent meal. 

I decided to get a deluxe Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich with a banana pudding milkshake. The sandwich featured a giant slab of chicken breast which is layered alongside some dill pickle chips, tomato, lettuce and American cheese. It was served in a regular bun although they also offer it in a wheat bun (I had no idea). As I stated earlier, the chicken itself was ridiculously good - it was moist, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The sandwich wasn't dry and the ingredients worked very well together and I must say that it exceeded my expectations.

Then came the milkshake which was very sweet, a bit too sweet for my taste. But the flavor was rather unique for us 'Yankees' in the North. Banana pudding isn't something we find often around here and having it in a milkshake was interesting to say the least. It had bits of nilla wafers floating around it in, creating these little chunks of deliciousness. Those same chunks also kept clogging my straw though which wasn't as much fun...

All in all, this joint provides some more than decent, tender chicken goodness alongside some casual, Southern-inspired fare. From sweet ice tea to carrot and raisin salad, waffle potato fries and spicy chicken wraps, the options are varied. Most of it isn't all that healthy but they do seem to make a better effort than most fast food chains.

The cashier was very friendly as was the rest of the staff, going as far as walking up to nearby patrons in the food court and offering free refills on some of their drinks. I'd love to be able to give them 3 and a half stars but this not being possible, I will round it down because... well... despite the chicken being good, they are a chain... and somewhat unhealthy.

1806,Chick-fil-A,2.0,"Whoa Nellie, all these glowing reviews for a mall food court stand. During my annual holiday schlep to the malls, I was pleasantly surprised at how the otherwise deadly dull Burlington Mall had a pretty decent food court, at least going by my very nice experience at ShotCakes (try a Red Velvet or Cookie Dough) and Charley's Grilled Subs (that was a darn good cheesesteak). I saw the Chick-Fil-A across the way, and thought, ""Hmmm...maybe next holiday season, if they are still here...""

But I had reason to go by there again recently, and  thought to check out the Yelp reviews for the Chick-Fil-A beforehand to see if that was worth skipping over another cheesesteak. The reviews were certainly promising enough so I stopped by in the evening and got the ""Classic"" chicken sandwich, waffle fries and a Coke. 

Unfortunately and surprisingly, my experience was very, very different from the glowing Yelp reviews: the chicken tasted like supermarket fried chicken that was left in the warmer for too long, and it was on this really cheap, cheap hamburger bun. As far as the waffle fries go, I only have the waffle fries at Charlie's Kitchen to compare them to, and Charlie's blows them away in terms of crispness and taste. Granted that Charlie's is not a fast food stand, still... At least the Coke was fresh and bubbly, and the overall meal was cheap enough.

I didn't want to post such a negative review based on just one sandwich experience. so I actually made another trip a day or so later to verify my experience, and for comparison I also stopped by McDonald's twice: once for their ""Classic"" chicken sandwich (crispy style), and once for their ""Southern Style Chicken Sandwich,"" which is reportedly a close knock-off of the Chick-Fil-A Classic. 

In the order I had them: the McDonald's Classic came on a much nicer roll and the chicken was predictably good enough to polish off easily but not nearly good enough to generate a craving for one later. I then had another Chick-Fil-A Classic and instead of the waffle fries, I got a large chocolate shake on a whim when I saw someone else get one. The chicken this time was much better than from my first trip, but,,,,it was still just OK. It was a little bit more tasty than the McDonald's Classic, but it still had the cheap, too soft hamburger bun. Overall, I would give the McDonald's a very slight edge. The chocolate shake, though, rocked, which was helped by the old-school inclusion of whipped cream and a cherry on top. If you include the shake, that actually did make for nice meal. A couple of days later I popped in a McDonald's again, this time for their ""Southern Style Chicken Sandwich"" and that turned out to be nearly identical to the Chick-Fil-A, both in flavor and having (unfortunately) a cheap soft bun. I got it with an ice coffee, and that actually worked very well with the sandwich. Sandwich to sandwich, it was pretty much a toss-up. The Chick-Fil-A is slightly cheaper, though.

To be fair, I was comparing the sandwiches from a full blown McDonald's to a food court stand, but apparently the only Chick-Fil-A's in this area are at mall food courts, and there was a line the second time I went, so they apparently do have fans, Still, in all honesty I have to give that  first sandwich only 1 star and the second a 3, so I''m splitting the difference.

1818,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"Love, love, love Chick-Fil-A. Growing up in the South, you find one of these every mile, and it was always the place to go when McDonald's or Burger King didn't cut it, which was often.

When I came up to Boston for school and found out that there was a Chick-Fil-A in the general vicinity, I was so happy. Then I mapquest'd it and realized it was not even close to where I was staying, which put me into a deep depression. You will understand once you've had a taste. There aren't many things I have a craving for, but Chick-Fil-A is definitely up there on the list. 

Well, I ended up getting here eventually through public transportation and it was just absolute heaven. Thank God it's just as good here as in the South, and dare I say maybe even better. I had the Chicken Sandwich and it was just juicy and fried and delicious. I know there are other things on the menu, but this is what you eat when you haven't been to Chick-Fil-A in a while. Couple that with waffle fries and wash it down with sweet tea and you've made this southern boy very, very happy. 

Other reasons to love Chick-Fil-A:

1) Food - Much better than other fast food places. While it's not particularly healthy, the food is of much higher quality, so you don't feel as guilty. I like everything on the menu, even the salads (which I normally dislike). The new additions of milkshakes and parfaits are great.

2) Service - I didn't know what to expect since I've had my fair share of bad customer service up in the North, and this is just a fast food place, but I was surprised to see that they had instilled some good ole' southern hospitality in the workers. The workers were very friendly and polite. Some guy even offered to refill my cup while I was eating... awesome! 

3) Community involvement - I don't know about their community relations here, but I know they've always given back to the local community and schools. In Georgia, basically each town has its local Chick-Fil-A, and they always partner with schools to award student achievement  (free coupons!). I know they have their own scholarship program as well.

The only negative I had was that prices were more expensive than down south -- paid almost $7 for the meal instead of $5 to 6. But I am willing to put up with that as long as I can get my hands on that damn good sandwich.

Writing this is making my mouth water. I'll definitely be back again as soon as I get a craving.

Very reasonably priced. And healthier than most other fast food option. It depresses me that this is the only Chick Fil in the whole state because I really like the food. I was there today and there was a huge line, I expected to have to wait forever to place and order and get my food but someone took my order within 2 minutes and 2 minutes later I had my sandwich. And they don't charge extra for sauce like Mcdonalds does and always ask if you want any with whatever you order. I was sitting in the middle of the food court today and a Chick Fil A employee came up to me and asked if I'd enjoyed my food and if I'd like a refill on my drink. This was the first time I'd experienced such great customer service at a fast food place.

They don't have them ready though, so you will have to wait about 10 minutes for them.  

I have been going to Chick-Fil-A restaurants for many, many years and I've been to a lot of them.  I gave this one 5 stars because of the fabulous customer service we received every morning.  Most of you already know that Chick-Fil-A is known for their outstanding customer service at all of their restaurants, but they really went above and  beyond here.  

A little something extra they did here every morning was put mints and those little hand sanitizer napkins in the bag with our food.  It may not seem like much, but I haven't seen it done at any Chick-Fil-A before.  

Because we had to wait the 10 minutes every morning, we would have to pull forward.  Each morning a different person brought our food out, but every one of them brought it with a smile and wished us a good day.

1867,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"Probably the best experience I've had at a Chick-fil-A, and that's saying something. I was going to go through the drive through, which, as always, was packed with cars. The restaurant had about 3 employees out there taking orders and greeting customers. One lady was standing at the door and in between taking orders, made sure to open the door for guests arriving/departing and greeting/thanking each one as they walked out. The restaurant has warmers installed above where the staff stands to take orders by the way (talk about taking care of your employees). 

I walked in and was greeted as usual. The line was fairly short and I got my food within 10 minutes. While I sat at a table to wait, someone brought me my order and asked if I needed anything else. In addition, about 10 minutes into me enjoying the meal, someone came around and asked if I needed a refill...I almost felt like I needed to leave a tip on the table when I was leaving. 

I got the regular chicken sandwich (free from the owner for downloading the app and setting that restaurant as my ""default,"" if you will) with a large fry and a large coke. It was as expected, delicious. However, this review isn't about the food as much as the staff. They were excellent. Keep it up Chick-fil-A.

At the speaker, I mentioned the errors made in the mall and asked if they could fix it (provide the missing chicken sandwich and 6 nuggets). I did not mention the cold fries.

I ordered the replacements anyway and asked to speak to the manager after I made my payment. Jodi, came to the window with a rude demeanor.

I sat in the drive thru line which was huge, but it didn't move. Odd, because usually CFA processes drive thru lines well. After seeing no movement I decided to run inside to get my sandwich. Well it looked like a bomb had gone off with trash everywhere. The line was 8-10 deep, I saw nobody working the register, and there were about 6 groups of people standing waiting for their food looking quite annoyed. I asked one of the people waiting if he had been waiting long and he said ""oh yeah.""

Their sweet tea is really sweet, which I like (I'm addicted to sugar, I know...). Every time we went, I usually ordered the bite-sized chicken nuggets with the waffle fries and the sweet tea.

I could give this Chick-fil-A three or four stars and complain about the long line at both the drive thru and the register in the dining room. But that would be unfair. Especially when the employees do their best to get the line moving. The only problem I had here was trying to back out of my parking space. But that is a minor detail.
With a long line for drive thru service, I decided to go inside and order at the counter. Although the line was long, it moved at a rapid pace. My server, Debbie, was very friendly and courteous. And my order came out quickly. Before you could even say ""Eat mor chikin'!""
I ordered the medium Chick-fil-A sandwich, and a medium drink and french fries. LOVE the french fries! My total cost came up to $6.38. And both the sandwich and fries were served hot.

This location needs better staff and people that can run the registers. It also seems like some skateboard kids stop by in here every Friday because  I notice one of the lady's that works there saying something to the manager and then him just telling her to clean it up after the kids left a mess in there table.

I go to the drive-thru and it being 9:20PM on a Saturday night, they ran out of spicy chicken sandwiches. They informed me that it's a 5 minute wait and offered something in the meantime. The young man was apologetic and extremely friendly and did his best to serve me at that short moment despite the 6+ cars behind me. I didn't want anything extra but I parked my car in a reserved spot, and waited.

About five minutes later and a nice young woman comes up to my car and apologizes profusely and comes to me with fresh food and a coupon for a free meal for the next time.

You don't get it any better than that. I had no problem waiting, especially since they were apologetic and attempted to resolve the situation in a quick, efficient matter, and that's something extremely rare in the fast-food world. When something is wrong in a different fast food restaurant, they don't care that you wait and usually don't apologize, but this particular Chick-fil-A does (and likely other branches) and they do it with a genuine smile.

I actually/generally speaking like Zaxby's better than Chick-fil-A. In my humble opinion their food is seasoned a little better although it can be a touch on the salty side. That being said, I hadnt eaten all day, needed to make it to the bank and I know Chick-fil-A to be quick. Not to mention I had a weird craving for waffle fries. 

This location was just that. Granted it was 3pm, long after the lunch rush. But I found the cashier to be friendly, engaged and quite helpful. If it werent for her I would have forgotten they offered Ranch dressing. And their Ranch is quite tasty indeed. I ended up getting a Deluxe Chicken Sandwich (fried) w Pepper Jack, Lettuce, Tomatoes and Pickles. The sandwich was pretty good. Nothing spectacular like my sandwich the other day from El Super Pan but then again its Chick-fil-A. Fries could have been a touch warmer/hotter. I also got an Arnold Palmer but forgot on freagin tart their Lemonade is. Luckily they had no issue pouring some out and putting more Sweet Tea. Still not a Waffle House Arnold Palmer but beggars cant be choosers.

Their chicken is delish! Very fresh and juicy, and their sauces are the BEST! Honey Roasted BBQ and Polynesian are my favorite. The chicken sandwiches they are famous for.... well there's a reason WHY they are famous for it! SO GOOD (next to them being the first)

So I shouldn't complain. But after waiting probably close to 5 minutes or more for the sandwich, only then did they ask me to pull off to the side and wait for it.

1943,Chick-fil-A,1.0,"As a frequent chickfila customer, I have gone through this drive thru so many times now only to be given the wrong order. I always try to give them the benefit of the doubt but today is the last time I will ever be a customer at this location again. 

I went through the drive thru today for lunch with a co-worker at this location. We both ordered two spicy chicken sandwich meals with chickfila sauce and even paid together just to make it easier. It is typically busy during lunch hour so we expect to have to wait a few minutes, however this parking lot and the wait time just to turn right into the parking lot from Hwy 71 is absurd. What made it worse is after waiting in this mayhem, we got back to our office on South Lamar to discover we were given the wrong order entirely. We opened our bag to find an 8-count chicken nugget meal with fries, which is not even close to what we ordered. Our receipt was also right on top of our incorrect meal with the correct order printed on the receipt ticket???

We then get back in the car and drive all the way back to the location to correct the order. We understand accidents happen but when my co-worker asked to speak with a manager, he was told there was no manager on duty.....NO MANAGER on duty during one of the BUSIEST hours of the day?!?!? That is just not acceptable. The guy at the counter went back and grabbed two spicy chicken sandwiches and tossed them in a bag and handed them to my co-worker assuming that alone would appease him. He explained to the guy at the counter that we just lost an hour of our day driving back and forth to this location and were not happy about the entire experience from start to finish and wanted to speak to someone about it that could correct the situation...manager or no manager. The guy at the counter said ""this is the best I can do"", handed my co-worker the bag, and didn't seem to care about the inconvenience or the fact that we were upset. Again, I understand accidents happen but I've never seen such horrible customer service and down right carelessness. We left with no chickfila sauce, no receipt, and couldn't be more dissatisfied.

In a nutshell, if you're looking for a good chickfila meal that is correct every time, then spare yourself the wasted time, energy, and frustration by avoiding this Ben White location and going to the Southpark Meadows or the 360/Westlake locations instead.

This place has an impressive drink selection. I got half sweet tea/half unsweetened tea; Alicia got half diet lemonade (yes, they also have non-diet)/half fruit punch.

And for the doggie we were given a BIG dog biscuit at the drive-thru window. Wow.

1964,Chick-fil-A,5.0,"I've been to this Chick-fil-A (CFA) so many times, and it's honestly my favorite!  Why?  Sure, this location is very close to my workplace, so it's super convenient for me to swing by for breakfast or lunch when I don't bring food from home.  But the true reason I love this CFA is the manager, Heather!  She is so amazing.  Heather remembers most of her regular customers by name, including mine - even though my trips to CFA are usually only once every few weeks or so!  I have never seen her with anything other than a smile on her face, even on those super busy days when CFA is giving away a free breakfast item!  That's what I call outstanding customer service.  As for the rest of the staff, I have seen a lot of turnover here, and they are not always the nicest CFA employees I have come across.  However, Heather honestly makes up for this.

While it wouldn't hurt for the staff to be friendlier, this is a high-traffic CFA due to its location surrounded by office buildings in Midtown.  Lines are often long, but they move pretty quickly.  This is one of the most efficient CFA restaurants I have been to!  However, I do recommend that anyone who likes CFA download the mobile app through which you can place and pay for an order, basically ""skipping"" the physical line and getting your food quicker.

I don't think I really need to say much about the food since it's consistently good CFA grub.  Again, I love the Chick-fil-A One app, which makes the ordering process super easy for picky folks like myself who don't want pickles in their sandwich and do want several different dipping sauces.  I'm a fan of the Garlic & Herb Ranch, BBQ, and their (fairly) new Sweet & Spicy Sriracha sauces, and I love that sauces are always free.  Chicken sandwiches and waffle fries are always served piping hot and fresh - likely because they're constantly busy during lunch hours.  Additionally, when there is a promotion for a free food item (typically breakfast, with no purchase necessary), they are on top of it and have plenty of it ready to hand out.

Other than their classic chicken sandwich, waffle fries, chicken biscuit, and Chick-n-Minis, I've really enjoyed their Superfood Side (salad) and their (recently new) Hash Brown Scramble (breakfast) bowl!  

For those who don't regularly come to this particular CFA, I will let you know that menu prices are a bit higher than standalone CFAs.  However, for those who don't work walking distance but still want to grab CFA from this location, there are a few designated - and free - parking spots right outside of the 725 office building for CFA customers!  Sweet!

Overall, this CFA in Midtown gets all 5 stars from me!  Thank you, Heather, for being so awesome - and for cranking out tasty CFA food every weekday!  I'll continue to frequent this CFA for its convenience, amazing manager, and delicious food!

* Tips *
1. Download the CFA One app!  It's so convenient to have and worth it as every purchase brings you closer to earning free treats - including dessert items and sandwiches!  Sometimes, the store will add free treats to your account for no reason at all.
2. Buy the CFA calendar when it's available around the end of each year!  For 2018, it's only $8 (plus tax), and you receive a ""calendar card"" with it which allows you to redeem a free item (and sometimes, two!) each month from CFA, ranging from a Dasani bottled water or soft drink to a regular, spicy, or grilled Chicken Sandwich - with no purchase necessary!  The calendar basically pays for itself after 2 or 3 visits.

1965,Chick-fil-A,4.0,"I come here for lunch whenever I am in the mood for their spicy chicken sandwich. I suggest making it a deluxe version so that it includes lettuce and tomato, which would make the sandwich more balanced, so just a few cents more. It comes with your choice of one of their sauces, and I usually go with their Chick fil a sauce which tastes sort of a mix of honey mustard and bbq sauce?

1967,Chick-fil-A,3.0,"I stopped by this Chick-fil-A ""Express"" for lunch on a recent recruiting visit to Georgia Tech.  Chick-fil-A existed on campus when I attended school here.  Back then, it was located on the second floor of the Student Center, inside the food court.  Today, Chick-fil-A is on the first floor in the Student Center Commons with other restaurants like Taco Bell, Subway, and Einstein Bros. Bagels.

This Chick-fil-A is branded ""Express"" because it does not have a full menu.  It looked like this location only offered half the menu offerings a regular Chick-fil-A would, if not less.  All of the popular/best-selling items are there, though.

There are several registers with roped off lines for each register.  I visited during a peak time, between noon and 1 on a weekday, and the scene was chaotic.  It was hard to tell who was in line waiting to order and who was standing around waiting for their order.  To lessen the confusion, perhaps they need a designated waiting area.

I ordered a Spicy Chicken Sandwich combo and the food and drink (sweet tea) tasted just as good as any other Chick-fil-A.  The only significant difference, other than this not being a standalone restaurant, was the rude service.  I saw one employee with a bad attitude get into it with another employee.  The downgrade in service is somewhat expected since the employees are serving primarily college kids, but I was a little surprised since Chick-fil-A is known for its outstanding and friendly service.

My order was filled quickly and the prices were in line with other CFA's.  Despite the service flaws, this place is a decent option for fast food on the Georgia Tech campus.

1971,Chick-fil-A,1.0,"Absolutely the worst Chick-Fil-A in any city or state we have ever eaten in.  100% of the time we have to wait a very long time (30+minutes) after placing an online order to pick up curbside.  This is after about 30 minutes of waiting to even go there for the pickup.  

The absolute worst was that we ordered 26 chicken sandwiches to give out to friends when we were about to go out of town for two weeks.  We picked them up (after waiting curbside for at least 45 minutes past the time they were to be ready) and tried to eat ours (the chicken was tough, tasteless, and virtually indigestible), but had to throw ours away.  We contacted others, who said the same; most said the sandwiches were NOT prepared according to the order, and all were tasteless and inedible.  

We did this as we were leaving town for two weeks.  As soon as we returned, we kept the receipts, and called Guillermo, the manager.  He said, ""too bad"", we should have interrupted our trip to collect all 26 sandwiches and taken them in to the store, and then wait for them all to be remade.  He said that because we didn't do that, there was nothing they would do to make up for this.  

This cost us almost $200, and was all wasted.  We intentionally waited until mid-afternoon when they weren't  busy (there was only one or two cars there), and still had to wait.  Most of the sandwiches were unlabeled, almost all were done wrong (lettuce & tomato when none was requested, no cheese when cheese was ordered, no inner paper wrap on sandwich so it oozed all over the boxes), but we still waited about 45 minute.  This put us very behind, and we had to leave to go out of town.

1976,Carl's Jr.,2.0,"This Carl's Jr is quite close to where I live, and right next to where I work, so although I usually shy away from Carl's Jr due to the higher than normal prices for fast food(and fast food in general seeing as I work in the industry myself as a manager,) I stepped in to give a try to them two different times.

The first time I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and a large fries. The fries were pretty tasty for fries, better than most other fast food fries. The chicken sandwich was dry and dull, though, barely suitable for eating. 

The second time, I ordered their breakfast platter, and here is where I was especially disappointed. I was given the choice to substitute sausage for the eggs at no extra cost, since I can't eat eggs, but that was a mistake because the only thing even decent in the entire platter was the biscuit. The bacon was limp and gross, like eating stringy tendons. The sausage was hard and overcooked, almost like a piece of charcoal... both pieces were the same too, which says their stock of sausage is just bad. What few pieces of potatoes there were in the entire thing--like maybe four pieces--weren't half bad, but it doesn't make up for how garbage tasting the rest of it was. $4 down the drain. 

I wasn't expecting much, mind. It's fast food so it's not going to be all that great. But there's okay fast food and then there's terrible fast food, and this was pretty terrible.

Most egregious though was the wait times. Both times I waited almost ten minutes for my food, and both times they were tiny items that should not have taken anywhere near that long. As I said at the beginning I work in fast food so I understand sometimes longer wait times do happen, because they have to fry something for the order because they don't have it ready, or because their line person is in the middle of prep and has to finish something first before they can get back to the line, but there was just no excuse for it either of these times.

1980,Carl's Jr.,1.0,"In the restaurant industry, cleanliness and sanitation are of paramount importance in order to avoid food-borne illnesses.  This restaurant.... not so clean.

 We went into the restaurant at about 2:30 in the afternoon. There was one other customer in the place.  The person who took our order was cordial and friendly.  Very nice, until I saw her wipe her nose with her bare hand.  Apparently she didn't see her action as something that required a thorough hand washing afterwards.  A few minutes later, with those unwashed hands, she delivered our meal to our table.  Eww.  Cringeworthy, to say the least.

We had selected the cleanest of the tables in the dining room-- all of which needed a cleaning, as did the benches for said tables.  There were obvious crumbs and sticky spots on them. 

My cheeseburger was okay tasting, as was my husband´s chicken sandwich.  Nothing special.

But... afterwards, we each visited the restroom to wash our hands.  In the ladies restroom, the soap dispenser practically blasted the stuff out.

1981,Carl's Jr.,4.0,"So, I don't particularly love Carls Jr but DH likes a spicy chicken sandwich now and then. I like the bacon western cheeseburger but I'm not a huge fan of burgers anymore. The Carls Jr by my house (and the 2 next closest ones too.) seem to have stopped carrying Spicy chicken. It seems they don't think people in Gresham like (or deserve?) it. 

But DH wanted his sandwich and he works hard so I was determined to find him one so I called around. Fortunately this store still carries it and it is less than a half hour away from my house. 

I drove down hoping they weren't lying about having it, and they weren't even busy. The drive through is really weird, it doesn't wrap around the building like most drive thru's, but OK. Getting in and out was a piece of cake! The food was hot and fresh, and although it took a little longer than a fast food meal should due to the distance, it all worked out.

1986,Carl's Jr.,5.0,"I haven't had Carl Jr's in several years, back in the day when I commuted to California and would hit them up on occasion.  I was always relatively impressed with their food and quality for a chain, so needless to say I was pleased to find them in Austin.  Finally a night I was craving a burger but in the mood for something different than the usual, I take a drive down south to hit em up.  

Surprised at the lackluster reviews I went in with the expectation of excessive wait times and mediocre execution.  What I end up getting is excellent experiences each and every time I've been there, very tasty food, and they've been consistent on quality and delivery.  Maybe it's a timing thing as I usually go late night and it's been the same manager / drive-thru guy each time - - but I really have nothing to complain about.  

First visit they had a double cheeseburger combo special, and  I also noticed they had a spicy chicken sandwich on their value meal so I threw one of those in (someone has to compare the competition).  The order taker then says to me:  ""it will be about 3 minutes on that chicken sandwich - - is that okay?"".  I told him no problem - - at least it's good to know that they're making it fresh now and it wasn't sitting in a warmer.  

I do wait those entire 3 minutes, but my meal was pretty darn good.  I was very happy with the quality, char-broiled beef, and the french fries were hot and tasty.  This was a refreshing change of pace to the Mickey D's, BK's and Wendy's of the world, and the quality is definitely a slight notch better.  I'm also impressed with the portions - which are nominal for what I paid as opposed to seeing the beef patties and burgers at Mickey D's and BK's get smaller and shrink over time.  Oh - the Spicy Chicken Sandwich beats the competition, a notch better for sure.  A distant second place = Wendy's, then Mickey D's.  I also love how they have both red and white onions, and they'll do both for you onion freaks.  

I held off on the initial review so I could go back and see if they were consistent, and sure enough each visit resulted in the same great experience - - a hot and tasty grilled burger with fresh french fries and friendly customer service.  I gotta give credit where credit is due, but maybe the night shift has their act together?  They're open till midnight or 1am on weekends, and I finally tried the Memphis BBQ Burger (pulled pork + burger + fried onions) and was quite impressed, it was very flavorful, hot, and fresh.

Yesterday, I ordered three chicken sandwiches: 2 for $5.55 charbroiled BBQ chicken and 1 charbroiled Santa Fe chicken. I asked for the Santa Fe to be a combo, with criscut fries and Coke Zero. The ONLY thing accurate about my order was the Coke Zero. I paid for everything, only to get home and realize they had given me only two sandwiches and regular fries. I got one BBQ and one Santa Fe, but it was not the Santa Fe advertised. Instead, it had somehow become a lesser chicken sandwich (I don't know if they thought I wanted it as one of the $5.55 sandwiches, but I paid for all 3...). At this point, it's not even worth it to go back and get the last sandwich that I paid for, because it would probably be wrong again.

Carl's on 82nd and Powell is roughly 25 for 25 on getting my order right. That scores big points with me.

2026,McDonald's,1.0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible.

In the world of fast food, McDonalds is King. And in the world of McDonalds, this location is the Jester.

It is horrendous. Unfortunately, it is the one closest (and conveniently 5 minutes away from) where we live and we have visited on occasion. Only once, ONCE have they gotten our order entirely correct and actually produced what seemed like hot, fresh food. 

On all other visits, we have either gotten soggy fries, burgers that felt like they'd been reheated on their little pans five times and then run over by a truck, and then reheated again on the pavement in parking lot, drinks that are dripping sticky soda down the side of the not-even-filled cup and orders that were completely wrong-o.

On our most recent trip, we ordered this (and this is getting personal now, disclosing my usual McDonalds order to the public, I feel like this is personal information):
1 Small Sweet Tea (she proceeded to convince us to order a large, since it is still 1$)
1 Large Fry
2 Double Cheeseburgers
2 4 pc Nuggets
Sweet and Sour Sauce
BBQ Sauce
1 McChicken

She displayed the order on the screen, proceeded to read the order back and it was fine.

We pull up to the next window, pay. 

We pull up to the next, next window and are handed our large drink. ""It looks orange, eew!"" I state, thinking that sweet tea would be a little more brown than that. But honestly, this is McDonalds, and nothing here is real, and I don't doubt for a minute that their sweet tea is orange, so I don't think much of it, other than wondering what the heck it tastes like.

We get our bag and drive off. Everything looks to be in order after a quick glance, 2 burgers, 1 chicken sandwich, 2 4 pc nuggets, fries.

Well, upon closer inspection once we got home, this is what we got:
1 Large Hi-C (explains the orange)
2 4 pc Nuggets (the only thing they got right)
2 Sweet and Sour sauce (no BBQ!)
1 McChicken (oh, sorry, they got this right, too)
2 McDoubles with no onions (didn't say no onions and McDoubles are different than Double Cheeseburgers)

We got a completely different order from what we stated and what was displayed and read back to us. I don't get it. My husband pointed out that the car behind us was still at the window when we hit the road, and our creeping suspicion is that they mixed our bags up.

The funny thing was, the orders were so close, and could sound so similar. But at the end of the day, they were plain wrong. And I don't understand how you mess this up? No offense to anyone in the fast food industry, but whenever this happens, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""and this is why they work at McDonalds"".

Ugh. Save yourself the headache of not only a wrong order, but an order that will be old, soggy and messy anyways, and drive up the Wendy's on American Legion or a different area altogether.

2036,McDonald's,5.0,"As a couple of Canadians visiting Orlando, we did not expect to encounter the world's biggest Mcdonalds right down the street from our hotel. Once we found out how big it was, we dashed to it after our long day at Universal Studios.

 Let me tell you, this McDonalds was indeed large. The building consisted of multiple stories/levels, and the food selection was vast. 

They had your typical mcburgers, mcnuggets, etc., but they also served waffles, pasta (with an exclusive white sauce, only offered at that particular location), oven-made pizza like back in the 90's, and an array of desserts consisting of: cakes, pies, build-your-own Ice cream, etc. It was truly a spectacular sight for all the foodies out there, such as ourselves.

So my boyfriend and I ordered two buttermilk chicken sandwiches, and made it a combo with fries. We poured our drinks from the super-cool drink fountain which had basically every drink you can fathom. I tried the lime fanta, which was ok. Though, the buttermilk chicken sandwiches were absolutely delectable! Literally the best Mcdonalds burgers/meal we have ever had. The sandwhiches were very fresh and warm with steam coming out of the bites of chicken. The chicken piece was huge, like two normal sized chicken pieces in a sandwhich, and it was very moist and juicy. The bun was a wonderful potato bun with a butter glaze ontop. The sauce had a prominent buttermilk taste to it, as suggested by the name, the burger was well-presented and definately not sloppily assembled.

2041,McDonald's,1.0,"I really wanted my first Yelp review to be of a fast food chain establishment. Just because. So here it goes.

Let me set the stage: it's 10:30PM, on a Thursday night, and I've spent the last few hours trying to convince myself that I'm not hungry enough for dinner. But at this very moment, I've finally snapped. Inconveniently, every place around me that offers a quick bite is now closed. So, I turn to the friend that is always there (or so I thought), McDonald's.

I pull up to the drive-thru window and place my normal order (Sweet Chili Chicken McWrap + large fry). In my desperate hunger, I also throw in the Artisan Chicken sandwich that is taunting me from the menu. There is some trouble relaying the order, but I think nothing else of it.

I pull forward to the pickup window (there are no other cars in line at this hour), and proceed to wait 5 minutes. Finally, the gentleman who took my order, who appears to be very high, comes to the window and tries to give me the wrong order (someone had pulled up behind me at this point). I send it back. Another 10 minutes pass by, and finally what appears to be a manager gives me my order. I'm a relatively patient guy, but waiting 15 minutes in McDonald's drive-thru is a little much I think. Anyways, I start eating my fries and begin the quick journey home, thinking that my trying times had passed.

When I got home, what awaited me in that McDonald's bag was the most bizarre order I'd ever seen in my life. At first, I popped open the premium sandwich box where the Artisan Chicken Sandwich was supposed to reside, and found two chicken breasts. That's it. No bun. No lettuce. No tomato. Just two chicken breasts. Which is one more than you're supposed to receive. I wondered who put this together and thought they were doing a good job. I mean, I appreciate McDonald's trying to watch out for my figure, but this isn't the time.

I reach further into the bag, and find some sort of weird-looking cookie that I neither wanted nor ordered. I throw that to the side.

2045,McDonald's,1.0,"This is the only McDonald's near my work and probably for everyone else unless you you drive south into DT Portland or go across the bridge. Tried to give this place a chance after a couple of screw ups but I just can't do it anymore. And here's why.

One, look at the storefront photo. I uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year (mainly because I had another bad experience and I need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suck.)

So the first time, as the photo shows, a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I usually order it without mayo and when I got my sandwich the 1st time, guess what? It had mayo. I just don't get why they can't read instructions properly or anything. Why can't the condiment be separate and not default? It's so frustrating. Any way, 2nd time I got the sandwich, they ""got it right"" except for the fly part. I already went in my car so I said ""F it"" so I just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettuce.

I didn't go to this location for awhile after this incident, but I was craving Chicken McNuggets and so since it isn't a fresh produce item or whatever, I decided it wouldn't be a big deal. Boy was I wrong. I think this might have happened twice but I counted my nuggets and it was missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal. I shouldn't have to count how many nuggets I have, but sadly these people can't do their job. I don't even get much time to eat lunch so I didn't have time to go back and complain. I'm done with this location any way so if I'm craving a sandwich or Chicken McNuggets from here, I'll just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isn't crap like this location. They know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job. The fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on Large Fries. The best place for that would be the Beaverton location near Uwajimaya off highway 10 (I think that's it.)

Conclusion: If you crave McDonalds, don 't go to this location unless you want dead flies in  your burgers/sandwiches or missing Chicken McNuggets.",  McDonald near work probably everyone else unless drive south DT Portland go across bridge Tried give place chance couple screw ups anymore One look storefront photo upload photo time review originally take early year mainly another bad experience need tell everyone come suck first time photo show dead small black fly lettuce Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich usually order without mayo get sandwich st time guess mayo get read instruction properly anything condiment separate default frustrate way nd time get sandwich get right except fly part already go car say F take picture proof rip contaminated area lettuce go location awhile incident crave Chicken McNuggets since fresh produce item whatever decide big deal Boy wrong think might happen twice count nugget miss piece meal count many nugget sadly people job even get much time eat lunch time go back complain do location way crave sandwich Chicken McNuggets drive across bridge go probably crap like location know serve ton people since location bad job fry bit overpriced thing case think get decent deal Large Fries best place would Beaverton location near Uwajimaya highway think Conclusion crave McDonalds go location unless want dead fly burger sandwich miss Chicken McNuggets,-0.010049019607843131,Neutral

2047,McDonald's,1.0,"Please check and open up all orders before leaving this location!! Staff will put a $1.00 sandwich into a $4.50 sandwich packaging to dupe you!

We knew it was going to be a memorable experience when we used the drive-thru at 1:00AM (it was the only fast food joint that was near us and we were extremely hungry) and the woman over the intercom gave us an attitude when we were deciding on what to get. ""WHAT did you want?"" She was apparently in a rush to... I don't know, maybe get her nails or hair done while on graveyard shift??

We ordered the Premium Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich, she repeated our order over the intercom. Great! Nothing is missing and it's just what we ordered.

Wrong. WRONG! This is McDonald's Sandy Springs we're talking about. I'm currently typing up the 90th one star review, what did you expect? This restaurant has its own sub thread on the app NextDoor! It's that infamous.

Once we received our orders, about 15 minutes later. I double checked the bag. All the correct boxes were there. There was an extra box of fries that we didn't order originally but was added to our bill for whatever reason (????). Thumbs up for the unwanted add-on, folks.

We get home, open up the boxes and we realise the Premium Buttermilk Crispy Chicken didn't look right. I'm halfway into eating this sandwich and it didn't taste right either. This imposter was definitely sitting in the right box but since when did the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken have shredded lettuce?

Then it clicked: the staff intentionally, out of pure laziness took a McChicken and placed it into a Buttermilk Crispy Chicken box. It took them 15 minutes to concoct this plan? They could've said ""Hey, we ran out"", ""Hey, we're too lazy to fry this"" or ""Hey, we spent 15 minutes not working and this is what we could come up with. Let me refund you your money.""

But this, this was intentional with the intent to defraud.
This was definitely one of the most disappointing experiences I've had at ANY McDonalds (domestically and internationally). I sent a message to corporate, received a message later from their corporate customer service team stating that management from this location would reach out and make this right.

2053,McDonald's,1.0,"This place is a joke. Unfortunately it's my nearest McDonald's. And it's on my way to work before I hope on the highway. So it's the most convenient thing to grab on my way to work. Everytime I go to this place they mess up the order. Not some of the time, not just a few times. I mean 100% every time. 

Missing straw, missing food, lids on cups on wrong way or missing all together. Ice coffeee with no coffee ( yes I'm serious). And about 10 apple pie orders messed up. Apple pie and guava sound nothing alike. I mean, it's so bad. You have to go into your bag and open the box to make sure they gave you the right thing. I have to do my job and their job. 

This is normal routine at this point. If you place 10 orders, 9 of them are wrong. It's just sad. When I'm not strapped for time, I will drive 2 extra miles out of my way just to goto another McDonald's because they are that big of screw ups. 

So what prompted me to write this review? Like I said, I'm pretty much used to there crappy service at this point. So I goto this garbage location on a quick late night snack. I order a crispy chicken deluxe meal with a sweet tea. Pretty simple right? I don't listen to loud music. I speak perfectly clear English. I don't ask for anything special. Just the way it comes. Simple. 

I check the bag really quick before I leave because I know how big of screw ups they are. Quick glance everything looks good. I  see fries, I see a box that says crispy chicken sandwich. I have my large ice tea. We're in business right? Wrong, I get home and what do I have? Two pieces of bread with a chicken patty! No mayo, no lettuce, no tomato, no cheese. Nothing. Just bread and a chicken patty. I mean how bad can you get. Do I literally have to check my sandwich and dissect it before I leave? It's a joke. Talking to the manager is a waste of time. All you get is, want me to remake it? 

So I get to hop back in my car at 10pm to drive down to your crappy location, to deal with your crappy staff, and you will probably mess up again.

If I went to China and tried to get a job in a Chinese McDonald's, I would  imagine they would expect that speak the native language. But I guess that doesn't apply over here.

2062,McDonald's,5.0,"Went there saturday night after finding out all kfc-es close at 11. dang! so not sure what to get cause i had my heart set out on chicken but finally ended up with the southern style chicken combo.

i normally ask a lot of questions but the person taking the order, want to say Alfredo, was super nice and helpful. Answered all my questions and made my sandwich perfectly. When I pulled up to the window to pay, I was informed that it would be 5 minutes and asked if that was ok. Since I was not in a rush, I said sure but that I wanted my drink when they brought out the burger/fries. The attendant then told me not to worry, I could have one now and that he'd bring me another on the house when my food was ready. Score! So for that alone, they get five stars. Its late on a saturday night, 20 min before closing, they've been dealing with brats all day, they probably want to go home and relax, heck some of the machines are already being turned off and cleaned, and yet they still treated me well and threw in a drink in order to keep me happy. that was just all around good service.


I almost docked half a star because the drive thru menu was so blah and looked like it had very few options.

2063,McDonald's,1.0,"I came here 2 days ago just yesterday morning (Sunday) on our family road trip up to Seattle.  Being on a busy driving schedule, we did the drive-thru, but was greatly disappointed at what I got.

I think I made a simple order - 2 McChicken sandwiches with no mayo for myself and an Oreo McFlurry for my son, and a cup of water.  I have ordered McChicken sandwiches with no mayo at countless McDonalds for the last 10 years across the US, and they get it right about 95%+ of the time.

This time, however, as I started munching on the sandwiches while continuing our drive up I-5, we noticed that BOTH sandwiches not only missed the NO mayo request, but BOTH sandwiches had DOUBLE mayo, both on top and below the chicken patty.  Instead of a NO mayo option, I ended up with a QUADRUPLE mayo-portions for the day.  It was too late to go back and complain and request a correction.   I was too hungry too, so I just ate them both, but felt my heart clogging up for the rest of the afternoon.

My order did show up correct on the order confirmation screen in the Drive-Thru window, and the order did print up correctly on my receipt, but the totally incorrect product turned up in my bag unfortunately.  I'll call the feedback number on the receipt to report the incident so they can hopefully figure out where they went wrong.

I believe the rest of their operations is probably good, but I am commenting on my specific incident here, which was my only visit to this McDonald's.",  come day ago yesterday morning Sunday family road trip Seattle busy drive schedule drive thru greatly disappoint get think make simple order McChicken sandwich mayo Oreo McFlurry son cup water order McChicken sandwich mayo countless McDonalds last year across US get right time time however start munch sandwich continue drive notice sandwich miss mayo request sandwich DOUBLE mayo top chicken patty Instead mayo option end QUADRUPLE mayo portion day late go back complain request correction hungry eat felt heart clog rest afternoon order show correct order confirmation screen Drive Thru window order print correctly receipt totally incorrect product turn bag unfortunately call feedback number receipt report incident hopefully figure go wrong believe rest operation probably good comment specific incident visit McDonald,0.03035714285714286,Positive

Last night my hubby and I were in a race against the sunset and needed to grab some food. We swung in to this McDonalds and ordered the following:

#11 Value Meal (Fish Fillet) - with a Sprite
Grilled Chicken Sandwich, no Mayo, Large Diet Coke

They confirm the order, we pay and pull forward...""Just Jack"" wannabe hands us the gigantic Diet Coke, and a bag of food. We patiently wait for the Sprite and he tells us NO, it isn't on the order. We say yes, it is, he then argues with us for 3 solid mins, even going so far as to try to spin the order monitor towards us so we can see for ourselves. He keeps harping that they didn't charge us for it. 

I'm not sure how many times we had to tell him that we were still missing a beverage, but finally, he huffed, and said that's $1.

I'm pretty certain he pocketed the money.

The other night I had to pick up my kid super late from the airport (her flight was delayed multiple times. It was past midnight and she was starving when she finally arrived). Because none of the food I had at home sounded good to her (!), I offered to drive through a Mickey D's to get her whatever she wanted. Her eyes lit up like firecrackers on the 4th of July. (Neither she nor I ever go to McDonald's, ever, but these were special circumstances).

We initially tried to go through the drive-thru at the McD just west of this one, on Marine Dr. SW (west of Cambie Street). Seems that McDonalds was undergoing some renovations and wasn't open (other drivers also pulled into the drive-thru here only to immediately drive away to this other McD a few blocks east. We were all part of a casual convoy together. lol). 

I've not been to a McD for years, so I was really impressed with this place (as was my kid). The menu offered a ton of choices. I liked that they offered breakfast foods all day long. All of a sudden, I had a hankering for an Egg McMuffin and a hash brown. (Don't judge! It had been at least 5 years since I've had this stuff). My kid ordered a grilled chicken ""burger"" with tomato and mozzarella and a mini-McFlurry. 

The guy at the window was super nice, our order came out fast, our order was perfect (no incorrect or missing items in the bag), and the food was actually really good and fresh. Yes, I said it. It was good. My hash brown wasn't greasy in the least (surprisingly), and the Egg McMuffin was great. My kid was in heaven (granted, she was really hungry.

2087,McDonald's,3.0,"It's a modern McDonald's. Go in at a peak time and order a typical menu item, and it appears just like that (like ordering a sausage mcmuffin during breakfast hours). Go in at an off time and order a grilled chicken item, and it takes a little time - because they are making it to order. Both of these speeds are good - fast breakfast when you just want to get in and get out, and a chicken sandwich made to order.

It's been ages since I've eaten at McDonald's and their fries still taste the same. Wait. no.. these were saltier? maybe they've always been this salty.

The only reason I came here is that there really are very little cheap dining options around the east end of the convention center, and this is the only fast food option. Otherwise you've got Denny's, IHOP, Red Lobster, and hotel restaurants ($$). Orlando, you could probably add another fast food/quick serve eatery in this area.

Also, as mentioned by Darcy, Amy's review is for a different McDonald's since this is not the giant one she mentions. 

Bonus: the Drive Thru signs on the pavement look like they are in some sort of Jason Statham action movie font. Also, they have strawberry fanta.

2089,McDonald's,4.0,"I've been feeling sorry for McDonalds lately because so many of its Russian locations have been closed by Russian authorities under the guise of violating food safety or restaurant cleanliness.  This morning, we heard its same-store sales are down a whopping 3.7% so I decided to eat at McDonalds today.

This McDonalds is a separate building outside of the Walmart Castle.  It's easily accessible from the 183 service road.  I didn't like how the parking lot driveway was curved around but it's probably easier for cars to maneuver through.  The parking lot was packed around 12:50 pm on a Tuesday afternoon but there weren't many customers inside ordering or eating.  

I ordered a Hot and Spicy McChicken Sandwich for only $1.08.  The sandwich lived up to its name.  I ate it and didn't have any poor aftertaste.  

My order came out very fast--like within 30 seconds.  I'll definitely stop by again since it's very close to my office.

I have a small appetite and get full off of a McChicken sandwich, so that's what I ordered once. The cashier gave me a look and was like ""AND?"", to which I replied ""that's all please."" Then she said ""THAT'S IT? JUST A MCCHICKEN?"" as if only ordering one thing under $2 was the worst thing in the world.

2092,McDonald's,1.0,"Every so often,  I find myself in situations which seem like they could have been lifted, whole cloth, from ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"".  My latest visit to this McDonald's location was one of them.

I grabbed a bite to eat at this location earlier this evening before catching a band at the Middle East.  I brought a McD's coupon from last Sunday's paper with me.  The coupon entitled the bearer to one free ""Regular Menu Sandwich"" with the purchase of a ""Regular Menu Sandwich.""

I thought I pass on the Big Macs and try two Crispy Chicken Ranch BLT sandwiches.  I placed my order and handed my coupon to the cashier, who also happened to be the manager on duty.

At first, he refused to honor the coupon for this particular order.  He pointed to the photo of the angus beef burger on the coupon and said that this coupon is for ""beef.""

I explained that the couple is ""buy one, get one"" on any ""regular menu sandwich.""  He again repeated that the coupon is for ""beef"" only.

I told him that McDonald's offers around 20 different sandwiches and they couldn't put pictures of all of them on a small coupon.  

He relented and honored the coupon, but from his words and tone of voice, it seemed clear that he didn't believe me and felt that he was doing me a favor by bending the rules and honoring the coupon on the chicken sandwiches.

He said that he would honor the coupon, but it would be different if I came in with that coupon tomorrow (Of course, it would be different.  I'd likely get a cashier who understood the offer and would honor it without argument or question).

Now, the backdrop to this transaction is that it seemed fairly clear that the manager/cashier was not a native English speaker.  While he spoke quite clearly, I suspect that his English reading skills are not quite the equal of his speaking skills.

Given the ethnically diverse workforce in the service industry, it would behoove McDonald's to briefly explain (and translate the verbiage, if need be) new coupon offers to their employees when they're distributed, so that awkward situations like this can be avoided.",  Every often find situation seem like could lift whole cloth Curb Enthusiasm late visit McDonald location one grab bite eat location earlier evening catch band Middle East bring McD coupon last Sunday paper coupon entitle bearer one free Regular Menu Sandwich purchase Regular Menu Sandwich think pass Big Macs try two Crispy Chicken Ranch BLT sandwich place order hand coupon cashier also happen manager duty first refuse honor coupon particular order point photo angus beef burger coupon say coupon beef explain couple buy one get one regular menu sandwich repeat coupon beef tell McDonald offer around different sandwich put picture small coupon relent honor coupon word tone voice seem clear believe felt favor bend rule honor coupon chicken sandwich say would honor coupon would different come coupon tomorrow course would different likely get cashier understand offer would honor without argument question backdrop transaction seem fairly clear manager cashier native English speaker speak quite clearly suspect English reading skill quite equal speaking skill Given ethnically diverse workforce service industry would behoove McDonald briefly explain translate verbiage need new coupon offer employee distribute awkward situation like avoid,-0.03203463203463203,Negative

A drink and French fries also come with the meal ( You HAVE to order the fries at McDonald's! I think there is actually a law somewhere in the books that says this is mandatory! ) My total came to $7.44.
Anyway, the dining area is always clean, as well as the bathrooms. The employees are friendly, helpful, and courteous. And every time I order from the drive thru window, I can actually understand the person working the window! I don't know how many times I go to a drive thru at other fast food places, only to ask the person to repeat what they said.
And like other McDonald's, this location has a playground.
Why McDonald's did not have playgrounds when I was a child is beyond me. I'm envious. Even pissed!
But I'll forgive them. Anyway, a good place to bring the kids. Especially for this neighborhood. And a convenient location, with Publix, CVS, Walgreens, and several other stores nearby. As well as a public school just down the street.
Coupons were given to me at the time of purchase, and this McDonald's is having a special through July 4, with $5 Meal Deals for lunch and dinner ( Sandwich with medium fries and a drink ).

DON'T even worry about complaining to the manager. Tried that and she turned up on us for having a complaint.

I usually take advantage of their flawless and very quick drive-thru service. My favorite meal is their Steak and Bagel Breakfast Sandwich. Man, is that steak good and peppery - just the way I like it! The hash browns are the perfect compliment along with a hot cup of coffee, of course.

For lunch, I prefer a cheap double cheeseburger (or two). It's only $1 and it's filling. I also prefer their Grilled Chicken Sandwich. It's quite healthy compared to most of the other choices. It's served on a wheat bun and if you exclude the mayonnaise, you've got a very low calorie meal. For dinner, if I'm hungry (and naughty) enough, I'll order the Double Quarter Pounder w/Cheese Meal.

2124,McDonald's,2.0,"If you're at McDonald's you're probably looking for something cheap, fast, and marginal to halfway decent. 

Well, this particular McDonald's will tend to pretty intermittently deliver some (or one) of those things. 

The interior has been spruced up a bit and features improved decor with local landmarks displayed, better and fancier looking seating, and crayons and other kiddie activities at every table. WiFi is free and available and easy to access. 

They also recently got two ordering kiosks where you can order and pay with no human interaction at all until a human brings the food right to your table!

The staff here tend to be very consistently marginal at best. You'll almost never get a friendly greeting or a genuine thanks. The ones working the drive thru always seem to be the worst. 

They have a large self service drink station (no coca-cola freestyle) which is always dirty, and there is always yucky ketchup spilled around the trash and ketchup dispenser. 

The food is... well... McDonald's. You can easily eat a meal here for $3 if you're not too picky about quality. They have developed some higher end beef and chicken sandwiches which are actually of good quality, but they aren't cheap anymore.

I almost went ahead and checked the YES box for DELIVERS in the business survey questions portion of this review, because YES, this Mickey Dee's does DELIVER!

Now let me tell you why. Three words: WALK-UP WINDOW (well, one of them is hyphenated, so does that still count as two separate words?). I can't believe the first reviewer didn't cover this! Sure, we all know the food is cheap, and this is where the homeless nest, but now I have to point on the convenience and second guess my word count??? That's a lot of pressure!

Anyway, I must say that walk-up window is clutch on a late Friday or Saturday night. It's fun too, because you never know who's going to be in line. It could be that hot chick that was grinding on you at Ringler's...and her cheap boyfriend. I also find it amusing in my drunken state to heckle the people in the drive-thru.

2136,McDonald's,1.0,"Sometimes you just can't go back in time. 

I went to this McDonald's after not going to any McDonald's restaurant for a long, long time. 

In fact, I was so dazed by my visit that I accidentally affixed this review to a McDonald's that used to exist down the street and has since closed. So, now I'm putting it where it belongs. And that's nowhere good.

Things have changed. Obviously, a lot of money and thought went into the decor, but they overthought it. The menu is now on an LCD display so that it's super-bright to the point where it makes the menu hard to read. If you're going to use a bright white background, then you should make the letters more bold so that the lettering doesn't get washed out. 

The guy behind the counter was fantastic. He seemed more like the manager, and he was doing his best to make things move along. 

So, why the single star? Because the food was awful. Seriously awful. 

McDonald's spent a lot of money advertising that they are now serving fresh beef burgers. But the problem is that people who go to McDonald's eat their food so fast that what we're looking for is a bold dash of flavor. If I were slowly chewing my food there, then the new burger probably tastes better than the old ones. But when you're rushing to eat, the new burger is kind of tasteless. 

The other problem is that all of their food was barely warm. I'm not sure how that happens, but the fries, the burger, and the buttermilk chicken sandwich all were barely warm. How do I know? Because when I unwrapped the Quarter Pounder with cheese, the cheese was cold. I'm not talking warm. I mean that it was cold and completely happy sitting in the exact same shape it was in when it was hanging out in their refrigerator. 

The Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich was awful. It wasn't just that they served it with no bottom part of the bun. No joke, when my friend opened the top to lift it out, we were both shocked that there was only the top part of the bun, then the mayo, lettuce and slice of tomato, and that was it. And so when she lifted it out, she immediately realized that the temperature of the chicken was cool, not even warm. 

The chicken itself looked like real chicken, so that was nice. But the taste was bland. It also didn't help that she ordered Buttermilk Chicken Tenders and got a sandwich instead. But at that point, we were so disappointed in the entire experience that we decided it wasn't worth complaining about, especially because the guy at the counter was so nice. I'm sure he gets hassled all day by customers yelling at him. 

The fries... Sweet mother of God, the fries weren't just cold. They were also tasteless. And to make the whole thing worse, I saw this dude, scoop the fries up with their little shovel spatula, dump it into the fries container, and then... no joke, he weighed it. 

What????????

If you go there, you'll see the little scale on the wall next to where they fryolater is. 

I'm not sure why that bothers me so much, because they do it elsewhere like at some ice cream places, but it just reeks of penny-pinching.

I have so many fond memories of McDonald's that it seriously pains me to write such a terrible review. But if this is the new direction, then I understand why there's been so much turmoil in the franchises. When I looked at the overall menu, it was just a lot, especially because now they have all-day breakfast. 

And I can't help but wonder if the menu overload combined with the fresh beef drive is slowing the workflow to the point where the food comes out cold in the end. 

Somehow I've never had a cold burger at Burger King, so I'm not sure why it happened at this McDonald's. And judging by previous reviews, this is a common occurrence.

Everyone in my complex that goes there jokes that you have to check the bag twice. If going through drive-through you MUST check your order. In the past I asked if they placed the apple pies in, they said yes and I took their words for it and drove away. Got home, no pies. I've asked for one boy toy meal and one girl toy meal and got two girl toys. I have asked for a plain burger, no meal- got the fries and no burger. Asked for a grilled chicken sandwich and got home with a burger. LOL.

They will correct the problem if you go back. The manager seems well aware of the issues. I have had family members visit who go in & brought the food home. The order was missing a few items, but they didn't want to go back. If you are able to check the bag right way, you can clear up the issues.

If you go during peak hours, know that the drive-through is a short line. So it will go into their parking. So if you park and go in, expect to stay a bit as you may get blocked in. Parking closer to the other business works out best. They share a parking lot with a Publix and other stores- so there are always spaces (maybe not close) but there. When you walk in they have a free for all order process. Great if slow, but if it's during their peak hours, know that if you get stuck in a slow cashier lane it's hard to jump to the faster one.

The location may seem convenient, being one of the two McDonald's in the Pataskala/Etna are this is the more convenient of the two because of it's location RIGHT next to the I-70 ramps. The location might be the only positive thing I can say.

In a general sense, everything is awful. They tend to hire anyone and everyone, which leaves service rude and not pleasant more often than not. SLOW is an understatement, even at times with no other customers in sight. The drive thru is painfully slow, I have found myself hopping out of the line and driving away on a handful of times. Inside the restaurant is not much better, and you're greeted with the horrors of the inside of the restaurant. On the off chance it is clean, it still gives a grimy feeling. The idea of sitting down to eat in this location is rather disgusting. When it comes to the actual food itself...uhh ehh. It is not uncommon to have something in an order go wrong. The food is nothing special. Sub-par when it comes to the standard for McDonald's quality which is saying something. 

One of my favorite occurrences with this location happened on the night of Black Friday. After getting off of I-70, I stopped at this location sometime before midnight. Pulling up to the window, I ordered two chicken sandwiches, no problem. Then I ordered a broccoli cheese soup and I kid you not, my conversation went like this:
""we're outta broccoli cheese soup sorry"" 
""I'm sorry, what'd you say?""
""soup machine broke yesterday I swear I wasn't here when it happened I just got here and bam it was broken""
....okay
""uhh alright then. Could I get a medium vanilla milkshake""

What I thought would be a ""quick"" drive-thru took over ten minutes.  I'm not sure what the hold up was, but perhaps one (or both) of the cars in front of me got a large order.  All I ordered was a Spicy McChicken Sandwich, small fries, and a cup of ice water.

Again, Curry Honda is located super close to the McDonald's, so the food should have still been hot (or at least warm) when I got there.  However, when I sat down to eat my food in the waiting room, I noticed the sandwich and fries were barely warm, and the ice in my water was almost completely melted.  I guess the food had been cooked and sitting out for a while, and they must keep cups of ice water ready to hand out to customers.  Boo.  

It was my first time trying the Spicy McChicken Sandwich, and I thought it was decent.  It has a very slight kick of spice and is at least a little more interesting than the plain ol' McChicken Sandwich.

Overall, this McDonald's gets 3 stars for being ""OK.""  Yes, service could have been quicker, and the food should have been served hotter, but this is a McDonald's and at least the employees were friendly.  I may return to this McDonald's if I'm on my way to Curry Honda and didn't have time to grab food elsewhere, but it wouldn't be my top choice for fast food in the area.

2174,McDonald's,1.0,"Note: this review was written for the McDonald's down the street and not this one because this one has been shut down for a while. But I can't figure out how to delete the review. 



Sometimes you just can't go back in time. 

I went to this McDonald's after not going to any McDonald's restaurant for a long, long time. 

Things have changed. Obviously, a lot of money and thought went into the decor, but they overthought it. The menu is now on an LCD display so that it's super-bright to the point where it makes the menu hard to read. If you're going to use a bright white background, then you should make the letters more bold so that the lettering doesn't get washed out. 

The guy behind the counter was fantastic. He seemed more like the manager, and he was doing his best to make things move along. 

So, why the single star? Because the food was awful. Seriously awful. 

McDonald's spent a lot of money advertising that they are now serving fresh beef burgers. But the problem is that people who go to McDonald's eat their food so fast that what we're looking for is a bold dash of flavor. If I were slowly chewing my food there, then the new burger probably tastes better than the old ones. But when you're rushing to eat, the new burger is kind of tasteless. 

The other problem is that all of their food was barely warm. I'm not sure how that happens, but the fries, the burger, and the buttermilk chicken sandwich all were barely warm. How do I know? Because when I unwrapped the Quarter Pounder with cheese, the cheese was cold. I'm not talking warm. I mean that it was cold and completely happy sitting in the exact same shape it was in when it was hanging out in their refrigerator. 

The Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich was awful. It wasn't just that they served it with no bottom part of the bun. No joke, when my friend opened the top to lift it out, we were both shocked that there was only the top part of the bun, then the mayo, lettuce and slice of tomato, and that was it. And so when she lifted it out, she immediately realized that the temperature of the chicken was cool, not even warm. 

The chicken itself looked like real chicken, so that was nice. But the taste was bland. It also didn't help that she ordered Buttermilk Chicken Tenders and got a sandwich instead. But at that point, we were so disappointed in the entire experience that we decided it wasn't worth complaining about, especially because the guy at the counter was so nice. I'm sure he gets hassled all day by customers yelling at him. 

The fries... Sweet mother of God, the fries weren't just cold. They were also tasteless. And to make the whole thing worse, I saw this dude, scoop the fries up with their little shovel spatula, dump it into the fries container, and then... no joke, he weighed it. 

What????????

If you go there, you'll see the little scale on the wall next to where they fryolater is. 

I'm not sure why that bothers me so much, because they do it elsewhere like at some ice cream places, but it just reeks of penny-pinching.

I have so many fond memories of McDonald's that it seriously pains me to write such a terrible review. But if this is the new direction, then I understand why there's been so much turmoil in the franchises. When I looked at the overall menu, it was just a lot, especially because now they have all-day breakfast. 

And I can't help but wonder if the menu overload combined with the fresh beef drive is slowing the workflow to the point where the food comes out cold in the end. 

Somehow I've never had a cold burger at Burger King, so I'm not sure why it happened at this McDonald's. And judging by previous reviews, this is a common occurrence.

2175,McDonald's,2.0,"Another tasty piece of crap? 
THE ""12"". Well the hype is on along with another flood of commercials for the new chicken sandwich. 
Ok, occasionally I eat at McDonald's just to fill my belly between meals, or even sometimes for something cheap to eat while I'm out! 
Overall, the burgers are just a piece of crap, but a TASTY piece of crap! Even though they taste like a warm soggy newspaper their still edible. 
I wrote in to comment once from reading the link on the back of the receipt; I said ""it's not meat"". Then maybe a week later they had a TV campaign boasting that it was real beef! eg. ""We're the meatballs your grandma makes, steak you cook on the grill"", etc, etc.

Ok, back to the 12: I ordered the 12 Grilled; and one or two bites in it tasted strange. Not like chicken but more like pork. But then I seen the meat was ""stringy"" like chicken is, but also so is rat meat! 
Even with the miracle of MEAT GLUE it still didn't quite taste or have the texture of chicken meat.
McDonald's food is processed to death; soaked in chemicals, all kinds of preservatives, and God knows what else. But the twelve is something else... Your guess is as good as mine! And why the name: ""THE 12""??? When it's for any time of the day.
My guess... It takes 12 Rats to get enough meat to make it (sorry rat lovers)! 

Dear McDonald's, Why not just make your burgers out of TOFU, if you're going to be cheap with the product you serve to customers! 
Stop lying and scamming fast food patrons around the world, and just say what your food is made of or has in it instead of making up stories???
In some parts of the world Rat, Dog, Cat, even possum and squirrel are a delicacy. 
It might have an effect if you tell people the truth, but you will still make money.

My recommendation... Eat at your own risk! 
Think about it... This is the restaurant that sells something called: the McWrap, ""Mc Crap"" they admit and market the fact it's crap.
BTW... What's with everyone giving them 3-3 1/2 stars???

The flat screen TV's tuned to CNN most of the time are a nice touch.  4 stars instead of 3 BECAUSE of the remodel.  

The drive thru here is super impressive......they have a conveyor belt that sends the food to the other side of the restaurant from the kitchen.

The drive thru lady did not speak very good English and could barely understand me and to make matters worse, the amusement park directly behind the Restaurant was extremely loud and I'm pretty sure the noise through speaker must make taking orders difficult. 

The drive thru lady sounded like she was bothered the entire time and had the worst ""resting bitch face"" at the window. After receiving my order I was told they had no mozzarella sticks. I ordered three drinks that were handed to me dripping with soda. She didn't bother wiping them or even handing me napkins so I could wipe them down. Did not offer a cup holder tray either. 

I ordered one Spicy chicken sandwich w/o lettuce and mayo only and added cheese. It was given to me completely plain. The grilled chicken sandwich was gummy and appeared undercooked. After arriving back to my hotel was when I noticed all of this and did not feel like going back especially with all the traffic on US-192.

2201,Burger King,2.0,"This burger king usually has some dirty tables, more then they should. The staff is kind of slow and more concerned with the drive thru.

The reason I write this review has to do with some thing that is common to all burger kings lately. It used to be you could get an original chicken sandwich, or a whopper pretty cheap.

But if you haven't noticed both cost $3.99, now I remember years ago the whoppers were .99 cents and were a decent size. But nowadays the size of all their pattie is noticeably smaller. Even the chicken sandwich is smaller and flat. Those used to burst in the middle and have a good amount of meat. Now they are flat.  If I had to guess they patties are 30% smaller across the board, you notice burger king never advertised their pattie size like McDonald's.

It's come to the point that you should never go to a BK without a coupon of some kind. At $4 bucks, you can hit up a steak and shake or even a 5 guys for a better burger or combo.

I asked for one meal to be paid for one card and the balance on mine. The Manager behinf her stated we they could not do that. I asked again as I have done it before and the card was quickly grabbed out of my hand and processed. She then handed me the bags and I asked for more ketchup and was told there was some already in bag - when I glanced in bag - there was 3 packets. I asked for more and some sauce for the strips. She threw in a few more kecthups and 2 sauces. I took bags and she literally slammed the drive thru door on me.
I was willing to overlook that until I got back to the office and both my co-worker and I agreed, the chicken sandwhiches were awful. So, I called and explained the situation and she said yes, she was the one that took the order and I could come back and get another one. NO APOLOGIES whatsover.

2232,Burger King,3.0,"This experience could have been a 1-star, easily. Multiple cars waited for quite some time before anyone even came to the drive-thru speaker, then car by car, filed through and placed our orders. For me, a spicy chicken JR and a value fry.

When I finally arrived at the window, the cashier said my total was $11+, when my order was only a little over $2. I politely corrected him and told him what I ordered, to which he gave a new total: $8+. Again, I gently reminded him of the items and told him it should be a little over $2. Finally, the amount was correct. 

I waited at the drive-thru window for-- no joke-- probably 10 minutes, before he pops his head back out and explains that they're short staffed and the cook hadn't dropped fries in the fryer. Would I mind some onion rings instead? Sure. No problem. ""What else did you order?"" A spicy chicken JR. Several more minutes goes by, he hands me a huge, heavy bag. Inside are multiple hamburgers and the onion rings. I'm all about karma, so I let him know that this must be someone else's order, and attempted to hand it back. ""What did you order again?"" The spicy chicken JR. Several more minutes, finally a chicken sandwich is given to me. He tells me to keep the burgers since I waited so long. And he gives me a large drink, too.

We came for the BK Big Fish (no longer available in the States, so we were surprised to find it here). It was... not as big as we remembered.

My wife said the fries were not very good; my onion rings were fine, not great.

On the whole, it was a fairly average BK experience. Might have been happier with a Whopper.

They had a number of specials running: 2 bigger sandwiches (Whopper, BK Big Fish, or their chicken sandwich) for $7, 10 piece chicken nugget for $2.99, so that seems a decent value if you are set on fast food.

The staff here are super friendly, when they have every reason not to be. When you ask for condiments, they will give you a heaping handful. When you decide that you want an ordinary chicken sandwich, and then proceed to add all sorts of custom toppings, they will grin and bear it. (You didn't think you could change the sandwiches did you? Oh contrare!)

They take any coupon you throw at them, including ones you've found online that are not advertised as being accepted at their store. 

Cons:

No matter how clean it is here, it still looks dirty. I think it's the lighting. It is rather gloomy and yellow tinged. 

Homeless people everywhere. Also drunk people. And angry teenagers. And unhappy sorts of folk who yell at each other directly in front of the doorway.

2252,Burger King,3.0,"To be fair, Downtown is always littered with beggars and some of the most RA (random a**) people that stream in from all over the greater metropolitan Boston area, so just coming to this part of the city is an adventure in and of itself. The restaurant seems to be slightly disorganized upon coming in. There is one cashier register that is by itself for whatever odd reason and may lead customers to think that a line should be formed there. Nope, you are lining up on the far left near the 2 cash registers that are off to the side. They were fairly quick and effective with taking my order for spicy nuggets, so I can't fault them for that. The nuggets are good but may catch some people by surprise considering how the spiciness catches you a second or two after consuming the nuggets. Overall, since you are in Downtown Boston, you have to expect some degree of seediness. If anything, they should prioritize organizing the lines better in order for people to know where to line up and where to go after their orders have been placed. Cleanliness isn't a real factor when you can (and should) order takeout. Overall, if you want food here, order on the go and just bounce.

Update: Ordered a spicy chicken sandwich out of curiosity. In a way, spicier than Wendy's but the sweet bun was a curious choice to complement the spicy chicken.

And i don't know how but we were walking in downtown Boston and she convince me just to have a small sandwich because we were very hungry but didn't had time to have nice meal. And i believe she was trying to  proof me that burger king food are not as bad as i am thinking. But this visit disappoint her as much as me.
I look at the menu and only one thing that i find i might like it was chicken sandwich because i hate the smell of burgers. Not the home made but in fast food stores they small as old and bad meat to me. Sorry for saying i know that lot's of people like it but not me!
My friend actually order some type of cheeseburger. The girl who was taking the order was talking too fast so it was hard to understand her so i decided to repeat the order but the girl seems like wasn't paying attention what i was saying and made such fast like she want us to leave as soon as possible, I'm really good with emotions: i mean when people think about something i can say just by looking on their face what their emotion are in that moment. Maybe i was wrong but that was my friend felt too so no respect for customers. Not good job
And as a result we got only one chicken sandwich  with $1 extra for one not fresh slice of tomatoes. Terrible and old taste coke for  $8.00 She didn't charge us for cheeseburger and i am pretty sure i told her. But i was really happy that we didn't get second meal because spend around $15 and get terrible food not for me. So we just share that small chicken sandwich.

2258,Burger King,1.0,"I've never been to such a huge dumpster fire of a fast food restaurant before in my life.

I sometimes go to fast food places because my dogs love nuggets. Yes I know I'm both a pushover and a bad dog father, but goddamnit they love their nuggies. So I indulge them once a week. I figured why not get a couple of my favorite childhood sandwiches as well?

I had actually been thinking about original chicken sandwiches lately. It's been a while, and I used to love them. Crispy, zesty, elongated, chicken sandwiches. Simple. Delicious.

When I got to the drive through, it took a bit for someone to speak. I don't know if you are supposed to speak first these days, so maybe that's my fault.

I stated that I wanted two original chicken sandwiches and the attendant said ""ok so 2 spicy crispy chicken sandwiches"" and I replied that what she responded was mistaken and that I wanted two plain regular ORIGINAL chicken sandwiches, to which she replied ""ok so two crispy chicken sandwiches"" to which I, a third time, said original chicken sandwich. I said we might be getting it mixed up and asked if there was a difference between crispy chicken, and original chicken, because they appear to be different items on the menu. They were. She then responded ""oh ok so you want three original chicken sandwiches.""

...just the two will be fine...

So after that she asks if I want anything else. More like she says ""...anythingelseforyou?"" So I ordered a side of fries and some mozzarella sticks. 

""2 chicken sandwiches and a fries. Anything else?""

""Yes the mozzarella sticks as well please, and two orders of chicken nuggets""

""...thatallforyou?""

I pull up, pay, make sure the items are correct on my receipt, good to go. I get the bag and drive off. I'm snacking on my fries on the way home, and realize the load is a bit small, so I pull over and inspect my bag, and notice no nuggets. UGH! So I head back.

I retrieve my nuggets, which came with a bonus taco, and finally make it home. 

I soothe my beasts with their nuggies, put away more for tomorrow, and sit down to eat my chicken sandwiches. I have been waiting for this moment. 

I open the wrapper, and...mold. There's mold on this bread. I'm in the restaurant industry, shit happens, so I go to tear off the bit with the mold, and upon touching it I realize it's all stale. My fingers graze the sides of the chicken patty, and it's soggy. I open the bun...and the lettuce is rotten.

Like...at this point...I have thoroughly died inside. How....like why the fuck....

Ok so if I were working there, and had fucked up interpreting this guys order three goddamn times, I'd want to make DAMN sure the rest of his order was right or at LEAST in the damn bags. You better BELIEVE I'm getting back into that line making sure those sandwiches are goddamn flawless, and you better fucking believe I'm in front of that monitor making sure EVERY GODDAMN ITEM makes it into the bag. Even if it was just to save my own integrity. 

I get it kids. It's not considered ""cool"" to work at a fast food place, of all times during the summer, of al times during the weekend. I get it, but while you are there, you need to be one hundred percent there. And this was not that.

For real this experience was more than enough for me to feel good that I don't eat fast food all that often, but I really feel bad for people that are eating that shit on a regular basis.",  never huge dumpster fire fast food restaurant life sometimes go fast food place dog love nugget Yes know pushover bad dog father goddamnit love nuggies indulge week figure get couple favorite childhood sandwich well actually think original chicken sandwich lately use love Crispy zesty elongate chicken sandwich Simple Delicious get drive take bit someone speak know suppose speak first day maybe fault state want two original chicken sandwich attendant say ok spicy crispy chicken sandwich reply respond mistake want two plain regular ORIGINAL chicken sandwich reply ok two crispy chicken sandwich third time say original chicken sandwich say might get mix ask difference crispy chicken original chicken appear different item menu respond oh ok want three original chicken sandwich two fine ask want anything else like say anythingelseforyou order side fry mozzarella stick chicken sandwich fry Anything else Yes mozzarella stick well please two order chicken nugget thatallforyou pull pay make sure item correct receipt good go get bag drive snack fry way home realize load bit small pull inspect bag notice nugget UGH head back retrieve nugget come bonus taco finally make home soothe beast nuggies put away tomorrow sit eat chicken sandwich wait moment open wrapper mold mold bread restaurant industry shit happens go tear bit mold upon touch realize stale finger graze side chicken patty soggy open bun lettuce rotten Like point thoroughly die inside like fuck Ok work fuck interpret guys order three goddamn time want make DAMN sure rest order right LEAST damn bags good BELIEVE get back line make sure sandwich goddamn flawless good fuck believe front monitor make sure EVERY GODDAMN ITEM make bag Even save integrity get kid consider cool work fast food place time summer al time weekend get need one hundred percent real experience enough feel good eat fast food often really feel bad people eat shit regular basis,0.03497425997425998,Positive

Placing the order was no problem. When I got to the drive thru I told them I ordered through the app and they asked my name. Then they came back and asked me a second time for my name. I was then told to pull to the second window. Pretty standard so far. At the window I was told that they had discontinued the crispy tacos of which I had ordered three. I was informed that I shouldn't use the app to order as this type of thing happens on a regular basis. I asked what we were going to do then and the only option I was given was to get they're $1 chicken nuggets instead of the tacos. I wasn't giving any option for a refund or for any other product. As my children like the nuggets I said I would get the three orders because they would not go to waste. The rest of my order consisted of 2 chicken sandwiches and two small fries. I customized both sandwiches when I ordered. I had to wait on my order while they made the nuggets. When I got home and unpacked the order everything was there. I opened the first chicken sandwich and it was made wrong, so I opened the second one to discover it was also made wrong.

2279,Burger King,3.0,"First, I can't be a fan(atic) of a Burger King on a knee jerk level, so A-OK it is.

This store sits smack in the middle of McLoughlin Blvd.'s run between Milwaukie's old Main Street-like downtown and its intersection with I-205.  The store appears to have been modernized at some point over the years it has been there, and probably recently.  Here's the deal as to why I even stopped in.  If you want to slam dunk something along the lines of ""recession food"" down the hatch from Mickey D's, your choices are largely limited to generic hamburgers and their McChicken sandwich which, unfortunately, is Cajun flavored and not my thing.  On Fridays, select franchised locations are also offering up a Filet-O-Fish for a discounted price but I get hungry on days other than Friday.  There, I said it:  Filet-O-Fish.  Filet-O-Fish.  I said it again!

Enter Burger King.  For a while now, they have been selling 10 chicken nuggets for $1.49.  Now THAT's what I'm talkin' about!  It is now easy to defect from Mickey D's and head to BK when hunger pangs strike.

For this location:

Food - 3 stars - boilerplate Burger King

Locale and physical plant - 3.5 stars - way nicer than a BK one would expect to find in Milwaukie, Oregon

Service - 4 stars - the one and only time I've been in there, which is recently, the guy at the counter was very polite.

2285,Burger King,2.0,"I wanted to write this review mainly to bring attention to the bizarre décor of this specific location, but I ended up having quite a telling experience during my recent visit. While nearly all chain restaurant locations are identical, this one is channeling a mid-90s formal dining room. I was sad to see that the portraits of smiling fruits and veggies that once adorned the walls are now gone, but the new drapes and wallpaper are nice. It just doesn't feel like a Burger King inside. It's rogue.

Anyway, I ordered inside, but the computer system was down. They couldn't process cards and their ordering system wasn't showing orders to the kitchen. While I wasn't in a hurry and they certainly weren't busy, the staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They acted like it was the end of the world. Someone dropped an f-bomb from out back. I was understanding of the computer glitch, but their behavior was unacceptable. I did appreciate the free small fry that they gave me while I waited for my sandwich though.The sandwich itself (tendergrill chicken sandwich) had too much mayo. When I got home, I added a heaping portion of spring mix to it to make it something a little more substantial. This is probably why I don't eat fast food often.

So, it's clear from the laminated sign that that speaker has been broken for a while and an immediate repair isn't in the plans. That tells you that the owners just don't care about this place. 

When I pulled around to the window a very friendly woman greeted me and took my order. Problem was they didn't have a menu posted at the window, and I hadn't taken enough time to look at the sign before pulling forward. Kind of caught off guard I just ordered a chicken sandwich.

I got the chicken sandwich, which was as good as I remember. I mean, I knew I was getting an old standby and not a gourmet chicken sandwich--a throwback to my youth. It was what it was, and it tasted fine. I couldn't bring myself to order fries, so instead I got chicken tenders as my side (not quite as bad, right?) =) They were tasty as well.

My only complain about this visit is that the service was slow. I realize it's an airport location and they have a crowd of people wanting some Whoppers. Nevertheless, the staff could definitely use a lesson on efficiency.

I decided to get a refund as this was nonsense.  Getting a refund proved to be an ordeal, as they had to get the manager.  The manager came out, visibly annoyed.  And of course, I had to go to the other register, trying not to spill my warm drink on the floor.

The register didn't work, so they had to back to the original register.  After card swipes, keys, and other waiting, I asked for my card back.

Escaping the clutches of Burger King was worth $9.35.  

The manager got angry and snapped that I was getting my refund.  How long did he expect me to wait for a refund at an AIRPORT??

I raised my voice three times, 'just give me my card' and he finally did so.

It has been some time since I have gone to Burger King anywhere, but I remember them having a decent grilled chicken sandwich- formerly the BK broiler.

I ordered the flame grilled chicken sandwich and requested it be dry and then specified- no mayo,  and a small fry.  I didn't notice until after being rung up the grapes were $4.29- typical airport I guess.  The food came up relatively fast although the staff was your typical group of slightly underwhelmed and miserable fast food workers.  We walked down to our gate as there was no seating open.  Upon opening my sandwich I found they had indeed left off the mayo, but also didn't put any lettuce or tomato on it.  The chicken immediately looked funny to me- certainly not a breast of chicken.  The dark color, texture, consistency and taste of the meat were all a bit odd and I can only describe it as a conglomerate of trash chicken parts that BK is now meshing together and making into a patty shape.

This is the location closest to my home, and between my husband and I, we've visited the drive thru a handful of times in the last two weeks. Each and every single time, we've had an issue rather it be an unnecessarily long wait (15+ minutes), food made incorrectly, unavailable and/or missing items. Today was the cherry on top of the string of issues we've had with each visit. After the kids soccer pictures and practice, we decided we'd get dinner from there since it's a bit late to cook. I ordered 2 PLAIN dollar hamburgers, which came with ketchup, mustard and pickle despite me asking for them plain. I also ordered two 10 piece nuggets since they had a deal on those in the past (not sure if that special is still running since I didn't get a receipt), and we only got one of those orders of nuggets. I ordered two of the double cheeseburgers for myself, ADD ONIONS, and those came with you guessed it: no onions. Ughh, how frustrating! I did get a jr. chicken sandwich with extra mayo, since they were out of the zesty sauce that usually comes with it, and was able to eat that. And then I ordered two large fries, which tasted as if they had been sitting there for hours and were only reheated to complete our order. I guess the only bonus is we didn't have a horribly long wait like the other times, but none of the cheese was melted on those burgers and they were cold. There milkshake machine was also down, as it has been for months on end. I paid $22 and some change for this crap, and didn't get a receipt to be able to prove we're missing items, even though I triple checked the screen to ensure our order was correct.

2330,Burger King,4.0,"Who doesn't like Burger King? Apparently a few people have had some bad experiences, but fear not - Rolland is here to dispel the rumors. 

After a long day of work, my stomach growling, I wanted something quick. I figured I'd swing by the local Burger King to satisfy my hunger. Perfect choice. 

I pulled in to the drive thru and eased up to the menu selection. I was promptly greeted and offered to try a new menu item. I politely declined, but it did sound tempting. 

I decided to spread the board. Not a meal, you say? Nope. I went for select items that I knew would satisfy my hunger. I ended up ordering a spicy chicken sandwich, rodeo burger, double bacon cheeseburger, onion rings (of course), and after confirmation of the promotional price - snagged a 10-piece chicken nugget for $1.49. I passed on the drink, as I had sweet tea at the house. 

I received my total, and was told to proceed to the next window. With a smile on my face, I thanked the person taking my order and scooted forward. I saddled up at the window with cash in hand. I was politely greeted by a nice lady with a smile. We exchanged pleasantries, made comments about the beautiful weather, and I paid for my meal. She informed me that my food would be ready shortly, and gently closed the window. 

As I was the only person in line, I didn't have much wait. Around 3 minutes later, a gentlemen comes to the window. He tells me that they had to put down a fresh batch of onion rings (YES!) and that it might be an extra minute. I told him it wasn't a problem, and kept jammin' to some tunes. 

Roughly a minute later, the same gentleman came back to the window. He asked me if I would like any sauces with my chicken nuggets. I told him I'd love some ranch and buffalo sauces - what a combo. Now, as he's gathering my order and placing it in the bag, he leaves the window open. The employees were all having fun and and joking around - seemed like a great night. 

My order is bagged and the gentleman, who I overheard called by the name of ""Cee"", politely hands me my awaiting dinner. He tells me to have a great night, and we parted ways. I drove home with the windows down, shades on, blasting music with nothing but the thought of Burger King on my mind. 

I arrive home and and immediately plop onto the couch, sweet tea and Burger King by my side. I open the bag, and to my delight and amazement, Cee managed to give me 2 each of BOTH sauces! Cee, you the real MVP! My order was spot on. Everything was fresh, and delicious. I ate everything in sight, and enjoyed every minute of it. I was completely, and utterly satisfied with my Burger King decision. I will most definitely be returning.

2335,Burger King,1.0,"In an area with many crowded fast food options, this place is always a ghost town for a reason. 

Room for improvement:

I've tried to order at the drive thru here several times within the hours they have listen online only to be told by someone that they are closed.

The couple of times I did make it when they were open, I've received burnt chicken nuggets that were hard as a rock, soggy fries that were completely flavorless, and chicken sandwiches that were chewy and stringy. Gross.

My most recent experience is what prompted me to leave this review. I ordered through the mobile app and showed up in the drive thru about 15 minutes later. The woman at the register handed me a bag that had been stapled shut and told me to keep it right side up because of the milkshake I had ordered. I know better than to leave this place without checking my order, so I rip open the bag. Of course, there is no milkshake. I tell the woman at the register and she claims she must have accidentally given it to the person in front of me. She said they just shut off the milkshake machine for the night and won't be able to get me one. This was blatantly a lie. Obviously they had not shut down the milkshake machine in the 20 seconds between me and the car that was in front of me and she had not moved at all to go check. She clearly knew there was no milkshake in the bag and was hoping that I wouldn't notice until I got home so she didn't have to deal with it. They probably have the milkshake machine in a perpetual state of being shut down. I am attempting to get a refund in the app right now...

The Whopper and Impossible Whopper are pretty good. However, for that price I might as well get a real burger at any of the bars in town. Yeah! Burger has a killer Impossible/Beyond burger.

This other employee arrived at a total that was a little more than I expected it to be.  I challenged that because at a couple of other places, they had charged a penny more than it should have been so I thought they were pulling the same scam.  Upon questioning it, she said ""you want to give this up for a few cents.""  I told her it's not just the money (although a few cents is a few cents) but it's also the principal.  She said okay as if she was annoyed and I ended up paying what I thought it should be.  As I was waiting for my order, she told another employee ""he's paying only $0.50 and he's complaining about a few cents."" If I don't think the amount is correct, I have every right to complain.

Everyone needs to do this once in a while, especially if they usually eat right and work out.  You MUST take a break from that mentality or you risk ending up losing your mind and ending up as a headline: 

""Man allegedly attacks shark with machete at New England Aquarium.  Suspect reported to have 0% body fat.  Shark OK.""

Use your cheat meal like a superhero uses his tight underpants.  Slip out of that boring douche costume and wrap that spandex around your balls.  Unlike Superman, though,the point is to look fatter.  Superman looks like the underpants are painted on.  Your waist should look like a mushroom.

Look at the beauty that is the crisp, salty fried chicken sandwich before you eat it.  Appreciate those crisp edges sticking out from between the buns.  Then gently lift a bun and savor the look of the thick, creamy mayo, lettuce, and fresh tomato.  Throw that lettuce and tomato out.  It's too healthy.

Eat it lying down on the couch with a can of the shittiest piss-beer you can find and say, 

""Fuck you, muscles!""

It's rare instances like this in which I truly live in the moment.  Like everyone else, I sometimes worry about what's out of my control.  But when I hear the crunch of the breading, my five-year plan evaporates.  I'm fine with whatever life has in store for me after I swallow this bite.

If I end up looking like Ralphie May, (R.I.P.), I don't care.  In fact, I hope I do.  I'm going to order another ten of these everyday!  I'm going to get as big as possible so my asshole family goes broke cremating me.  I hope there's an afterlife so I can see how long it takes for them to start looking at their watches while the oven gets refueled for a fifth time.  I will crack up when someone finally says:

""Oh fuck this!  I'm already late for my Bumble date.  Do you guys have a dumpster out back?""

Then some litigious pansy neo-millennial will sue Burger King for premeditated shoving of sandwiches down my throat and loss of opportunity to get laid.

2365,Burger King,1.0,"Short version:

This store sucks.

Long version:

Disclosure:  I must admit, ever since they re-routed the turn lane off Andresen forcing customers up to 88th (and not right into Costco), I've always felt sorry for this BK and the Panda Express nearby.

Can you imagine spending all that money to be next to Costco and then the traffic gets re-routed so it doesn't go next to you?  It's terrible, it really is.

Anyway, I finally said, I'm not going go to buy that Chicken Bake at Costco and I'll give this BK my money because they got hosed. Besides, it's only a twice-a-year craving, but I do enjoy  the BK Stacker (kind of a Big Mac knock-off), so what the hell.

BIG MISTAKE.

I decide to go in.  Classic mistake #1.  I forgot that most fast food joints get graded on how fast they are at drive thru (they've got that big 'ol clock a tickin').  Not so for the dine-in, which pretty much means you're the red-headed step child of fast food diners.

Translation:  I waited, no joke, 15 minutes for a BK Stacker meal.  15 minutes.  Three people were ahead of me.

They finally get to my order, and he said, literally, ""oh, a BK Stacker"".  He takes the patty out of it's warming tray, slaps on some cheese, and the nukes the crap out of it!  In front of me!

Then, because I'm a glutton, I tossed in a chicken sandwich off of the $1 Menu (Spicy Chicken something something).  It was orange (oooh, fake spices) and paper thin.  Blaghh.  I can eat almost anything.  One bite was enough to ask WTF Burger King product planners were thinking.  Better just to not sell anything than that abomination.

Ugggh.  No good deed goes unpunished.

2369,Burger King,3.0,"Burger King has really suffered in the fast food races in the last few years and it's not difficult to figure out why.  Their food prices have gotten so high for many of their sandwiches compared to their competition, the quality and size of their food offerings have shrunk and their special menu items have been, for the most part, failures.  They have also consistently been inconsistent and unpredictable in their breakfast menu choices and execution.  However I think one of their biggest problems are the lack of consistency from area to area.  Some restaurants are dirty, others are very clean, some charge you $5.79 for a single Whopper and others charge $2.99... It's just a big reason many people, including myself, don't go to Burger King anymore. 

This Burger King isn't bad, it's not great but it's not bad either.  Their prices are pretty well in line with what you'd expect, the help is not friendly but not rude either and the restaurant is usually pretty clean.  The only time I've really came here is when I have coupons which I sometimes find in the paper and that makes it worth it.  It's really just too expensive, in my opinion, to eat at a Burger King comparative to other local places you can eat so I really never go to any BK without coupons.  

One real complaint I have...the Whopper used to be delicious and a great burger, their flagship burger so to speak.  Now it's still the same sized bun, same lettuce, onion, tomato but the burger itself is thin as hell.  You really have to get a double Whopper to get about the same amount of meat you used to get with a regular Whopper just 5 or 6 years ago.  I think the Whopper Jr. is actually a better ratio of meat to bun than the actual Whopper.  And considering you're paying pretty good price for a Whopper they should not skimp on the meat like they do.

With that being said, the one sandwich I really liked when I got BK recently was their Italian Parmesan Chicken sandwich.  It was really tasty and comparable to what you'd get a decent Italian type restaurant.  I only bought it because I had a free coupon for one and was shocked it was so good.  So apparently Burger King still has an A game but they just choose not to bring it all that often...",  Burger King really suffer fast food race last year difficult figure food price get high many sandwich compare competition quality size food offering shrink special menu item part failure also consistently inconsistent unpredictable breakfast menu choice execution However think one big problem lack consistency area area restaurant dirty others clean charge single Whopper others charge big reason many people include go Burger King anymore Burger King bad great bad either price pretty well line expect help friendly rude either restaurant usually pretty clean time really come coupon sometimes find paper make worth really expensive opinion eat Burger King comparative local place eat really never go BK without coupon One real complaint Whopper use delicious great burger flagship burger speak still sized bun lettuce onion tomato burger thin hell really get double Whopper get amount meat use get regular Whopper year ago think Whopper Jr actually good ratio meat bun actual Whopper consider pay pretty good price Whopper skimp meat like say one sandwich really like get BK recently Italian Parmesan Chicken sandwich really tasty comparable get decent Italian type restaurant buy free coupon one shock good apparently Burger King still game choose bring often,0.09274761904761906,Positive

I don't even think I've ever had anything that was messed up or missing. There was one time I ordered a chicken sandwich that was absolutely old and gross but I also know that if you're going to order fast food and you want it fresh then you need to make a substitution or change something on it so that it can be made fresh. Maybe a lot of people don't think of something like that but that's definitely the quickest way and easiest way to get fresh fast food. Every time I come here I've been in and out pretty fast. I do DoorDash in this area so sometimes I pick up orders here and I prefer to go inside to pick them up rather than going through the drive-through so you don't have to wait for other peoples orders to be made. They are pretty fast in the drive-through though so it's not like he would be waiting for very long. If you do go to use a coupon they do ask that you give them the coupon code when you order and before you get to the window so that they can input it correctly into the system instead of it being last minute.

2380,Burger King,1.0,"You really have to be kidding. I know that fast food isn't supposed to be great, however this one has consistently made it obvious that it can be horrible if the people preparing it don't care at all. 

They have a nice indoor playscape for kids and I've taking 3 different grand kids there over several years. Every single visit the food has been exceptionally poor. The tables dirty and the attitude of the people there apathetic.

The other night I ordered a kid's meal with chicken nuggets and apple sauce. I also ordered chicken fries for myself, trying them for the first time. While waiting a long time at the counter (I waited well over 5 minutes for them to first take my order, with the place completely empty. Apparently there was some drive-thru activity though), I did notice the run-down, lack of care that the place still exhibited. When my ""food"" finally came, they had given me fries instead of apple sauce on the kids meal. I also wanted to order a diet coke for my wife who had asked after I placed the first order. They gave me the apple sauce and nicely just gave me a cup for the drink.

I went to get some ketchup and the mostly empty, half disassembled pump squirted it onto my wrist. Ok, these aren't good signs.

Now to the alleged food. I notice they also gave me an unordered chicken sandwich as well. The chicken fries were so over cooked as to be inedible. The nuggets although cooked the correct amount of  time, were tasteless and rubbery. The chicken sandwich, which I tried to eat was also over done to being inedible.
